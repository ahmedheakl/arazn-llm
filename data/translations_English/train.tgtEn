I01-C03-R02_074420-074510	Okay
I01-C03-R02_074510-075216	Okay I will read the question as it is in a class or in general would you rather be liked or respected?
I01-C03-R02_076930-077488	Okay do you feel like you are an easy person to talk to or not?
I01-C03-R02_078534-078670	Okay

I01-C03-R02_079722-080496	Do you not feel like when we're talking to people from a lower social level that you are not talking in the same way you would use with other people for example?
I01-C03-R02_080496-080939	So he may not understand me if I talk in English or if I said anything he would not understand me

I01-C03-R02_094704-095822	Okay okay did you do the same just to make others feel that is to impress others?
I01-C03-R02_095822-096726	I mean if there is for example actually there was someone who said that he did so at at school for a school interview to be able to to enroll his son to school so he had to speak English in the interview and so on?
I01-C03-R02_096726-097047	So did you need to do that to make the other people get impressed or something of that sort?

I01-C03-R03_056482-056740	You mean if I have another role model in real life?
I01-C03-R03_057987-058908	Do you prefer that people do you a favor because they like you or because they have to respect you as they believe that they do this because they respect you?
I01-C03-R03_059545-059691	Good
I01-C03-R03_059937-060651	[HES] Do you that you are an easy person to talk with and to have a friendly talk with or you need ice breaking for some time?
I01-C03-R03_060937-061060	Why?
I01-C03-R03_061277-061536	So people don't talk with you easily and don't get used to you.
I01-C03-R03_061825-062099	Okay
I01-C03-R03_066841-067745	Even if you don't interact with people in an education context, you will meet in an event or something.
I01-C03-R03_068493-068621	Okay
I01-C03-R03_068621-068914	[HES] well okay
I01-C03-R03_069829-070037	What they usually tell you that he always does this
I01-C03-R03_070037-070277	For example, you don't sit with us.
I01-C03-R03_073103-074174	Okay and have you .. used English in the middle of your speech so that people in front of you .. you .. think that okay you're in a higher social level definitely?

I01-C03-R03_078617-079296	Okay, well [HES] you can choose anything and persuade us to do.
I01-C03-R03_079296-079677	Anything, anything like traveling or working.
I01-C03-R03_079979-080463	For example, we are here at the .. university and we haven't traveled abroad so why did you travel abroad?
I01-C03-R03_080463-080587	Persuade me as I was not convinced to travel abroad.
I01-C03-R03_081717-081784	No.
I01-C03-R03_082238-083013	Because they .. didn't pay what other people paid to learn
I01-C03-R03_083013-083342	They didn't exert the same effort that other people had exerted to learn.
I01-C03-R03_083342-084594	Yes, the play it and they like it but at the end they got paid more than other people that really worked hard in education so this is what affects the future.
I01-C03-R03_089301-089714	I can't say because it depends on work, field and position.
I01-C03-R03_089806-089923	No, definitely I don't know.
I01-C03-R03_090142-091193	Of course one like a manager team for example an engineer will earn a better salary than anyone else who's having a different job.

S02-C03-R02_050358-051389	I have no idea but I feel that many people went there they had an experience so I can go there.
S02-C03-R02_051914-052028	No, I would immigrate.
S02-C03-R02_052812-053578	If it wasn't German then it would be Emirates.
S02-C03-R02_054014-054914	In German I have contacts in these countries if I traveled actually I'm determined that I will travel, work and know exactly what I want to do.
S02-C03-R02_054914-055810	But in Emirates I have besides having already many friends actually, it is a promising market.
S02-C03-R02_057026-057112	I went to Dahab.
S02-C03-R02_057787-058015	This is the fifth or sixth time that I have been to Dahab.
S02-C03-R02_058015-058425	So No it's beautiful
S02-C03-R02_058425-058555	I like the country very much.
S02-C03-R02_058700-059500	We haven't any activities actually in the last trip but definitely we went to blue balls three pools.
S02-C03-R02_059500-059827	Everything in Dahab actually
S02-C03-R02_061070-061362	[HES] No
S02-C03-R02_061362-061969	I mean my life sequence is not moving in this way.
S02-C03-R02_063526-063833	Definitely life is not moving smoothly
S02-C03-R02_063833-064626	But I think definitely everybody can face problems at work.
S02-C03-R02_064626-065006	But I mean for example I faced a problem at my Master's time.
S02-C03-R02_065006-065376	But that didn't hinder me from doing it.
S02-C03-R02_065376-065660	Afterwards I discovered that it was something very strong.
S02-C03-R02_065660-066676	But the problem that occurred to me at that time was a big one and thanks God I overcame it actually.
S02-C03-R02_067970-068060	No individual
S02-C03-R02_068177-069270	I'm in control of every aspect of the work so that’s why I think that it is better to work on my self on my own.
S02-C03-R02_070371-070755	No, but is there a role model in certain field?
S02-C03-R02_070755-071219	I mean everyone I see is a role model in certain field
S02-C03-R02_071219-071974	Can you mention examples if there certain thing that you want to say.
S02-C03-R02_071974-073138	I mean so the so so in my life for example on the personal level I believe that my mother is a great person.
S02-C03-R02_073138-073842	At work I see that professor slim for example he's a very good teacher actually
S02-C03-R02_073899-074420	I mean I learn something from everybody.
S02-C03-R02_076332-076475	Respected
S02-C03-R02_077644-078391	I consider myself an easy person to deal with but you have to ask other people about it actually.
S02-C03-R02_079291-079433	No, at all
S02-C03-R02_079433-079722	I have no problem at all in this issue.
S02-C03-R02_081361-081500	No, I deal normally.
S02-C03-R02_081690-081928	I don't feel that there is any problem actually
S02-C03-R02_083193-083348	[HUM]
S02-C03-R02_083444-083686	Sycophants
S02-C03-R02_084370-086168	Yes there is a term that I won't mention, those people who want to impress their boss or or so so they kept flattering him.
S02-C03-R02_086168-086327	It's that you're you're great
S02-C03-R02_086327-086390	You're great
S02-C03-R02_086390-086515	You're wow
S02-C03-R02_087400-087565	When work exceeds
S02-C03-R02_088175-088641	I learned to classify tasks into urgent and important
S02-C03-R02_088641-089065	Do you know urgent and important distribution?
S02-C03-R02_089065-089358	It is that if the task is urgent and important it's the first thing to be done.
S02-C03-R02_089358-089670	Urgent but not important it's the second thing that should be done and so forth.
S02-C03-R02_091670-091993	To hide that I don't understand
S02-C03-R02_091993-092155	Yes, it happened.
S02-C03-R02_092633-093514	[HES] No I mean, I mean what was the reaction?
S02-C03-R02_094303-094704	No, I think it passed that's it.
S02-C03-R02_097152-097256	No
S02-C03-R02_097597-097669	No
S02-C03-R02_097953-098202	Because everything is there.
S02-C03-R02_098202-098422	Everything I need is there.
S02-C03-R02_098422-099129	I need it for communication with others I mean
S02-C03-R02_099527-099591	That's it?
S02-C03-R02_099665-099703	Okay
S05-C03-R05_001912-003005	Okay I used to live in Fayoum till the first secondary then I moved to Cairo because I was practicing in El Bank AL Ahly club and .. %k swimming actually.
S05-C03-R05_003005-003529	When I'm done there and I get to know my friends and other people and groups and so on and I get to know that there is a university called GUC.
S05-C03-R05_003529-003815	Whatever my total grade was I mean I enrolled here.
S05-C03-R05_003815-004102	Whatever my total grade was I mean I enrolled here in the university.
S05-C03-R05_004102-004282	In the beginning I wanted to joined Mechatronics
S05-C03-R05_004282-004618	And then I joined MET
S05-C03-R05_004618-004966	Currently I'm more interested in web development
S05-C03-R05_004966-005306	And I try to search for new interests.
S05-C03-R05_006473-006777	Okay, I selected the major I mean I was thinking at first about mechatronics.
S05-C03-R05_007414-008051	I found that in MET as well frankly many of my friends enrolled there and I know others who graduated.
S05-C03-R05_008051-008597	They took the Bachelor and did the Masters abroad or in Egypt so I liked the idea actually.
S05-C03-R05_008597-008985	And I felt that they are in so .. I can join more than field in MET.
S05-C03-R05_009349-009654	Not .. it doesn't have great reputation
S05-C03-R05_009654-009871	MET is different I mean
S05-C03-R05_010402-010710	My Bachelor is a verification of the online images.
S05-C03-R05_010710-011684	It's supposed that I received online use and I have to make sure of the source whether it's right or not.
S05-C03-R05_011684-012615	I check the photos whether they're correct or not, photoshopped, faked, ((corrupted)) by any means of new editors or any software applied on the image i can detect it.
S05-C03-R05_012615-013372	[HES] to use several programming language not only one which is the only benefit in the Bachelor.
S05-C03-R05_014331-014503	I don't have a fixed routine.
S05-C03-R05_014503-014885	I don't have something in particular to do everyday.
S05-C03-R05_014885-015641	I can get up at seven in general I don't sleep much so I can get up .. usually I get up at five because of college and to catch the bus and so on actually so I get used to do that.
S05-C03-R05_015641-016074	[HES] I can tell you the routine that I'm getting used to.
S05-C03-R05_016074-016434	I was getting up, go to the exercise, return back to have breakfast.
S05-C03-R05_016434-016741	[HES] if I have classes at college I would practice at college.
S05-C03-R05_016741-017250	And then I continue the day at college and stayed there till six or seven something like that.
S05-C03-R05_017250-017927	Then I returned back by bus and since I live far away, I live in Shoubra so it takes time so I returned back home at eight o'clock for example.
S05-C03-R05_017927-018545	I just eat and watch anything on the internet on facebook, youtube anything and then I go to sleep.
S05-C03-R05_019094-020250	On the [HES] weekend most of my weekend I spend in club or .. in club or in exercise or meeting my friends or something like that but I don't travel thank God.
S05-C03-R05_020854-021423	Besides I'm getting used to swim all time but actually I don't consider this a hobby it's more a sport.
S05-C03-R05_021423-021725	[HES] I read a lot.
S05-C03-R05_021725-022176	And I like learning many languages as well.
S05-C03-R05_023127-023378	There is more than one book but I can mention the most recent one.
S05-C03-R05_023378-023584	[HES] a book called The Flinch
S05-C03-R05_023584-023829	For James something I don't remember actually James what?
S05-C03-R05_023829-024890	It's about the flinch when you're worried when you're about any trial to worry for example about jumping from the plane or doing anything this is called flinch it means that you're hesitated.
S05-C03-R05_024890-025434	So how do you overcome it and how do you go on in anything or try anything and not to keep waiting, something like that.
S05-C03-R05_025434-026038	I liked it because it shows that you shouldn't wait something in specific to start working, that's it.
S05-C03-R05_027799-028163	Okay since I enrolled in college I joined two clubs.
S05-C03-R05_028163-028285	Club Enactus
S05-C03-R05_028521-029447	[HES] in the club generally we are working on projects, not logistics, or HR or something of that sort certain projects we're in charge of a project.
S05-C03-R05_029447-029688	I was working on a project called furny cards.
S05-C03-R05_029688-030183	[HES] we used to deal with a big company related to decorations and so.
S05-C03-R05_030183-030854	[HES] they used to send us designs and we do [HES] furniture by using cards.
S05-C03-R05_030854-031027	[HES] car boards
S05-C03-R05_031027-032136	And we know how to sell it and we used uneducated or physically disabled or mentally to do the cards or to make furniture and to sell it so as to be a profit for them.
S05-C03-R05_032136-032501	I was in another club as well but it was race cars.
S05-C03-R05_032501-032902	[HES] he was in charge of organizing events
S05-C03-R05_032902-033238	And there are events that are being held here in the settlement.
S05-C03-R05_033238-033559	We were responsible of organizing the events I join as an usher in most of the university activities.
S05-C03-R05_033559-034081	[HES] this is most of the activities I do at college actually.
S05-C03-R05_034913-035880	I tried both working individually of course has benefits and team work has benefits but %k .. I mean on the long run of course it has to be team work.
S05-C03-R05_035880-036442	Working individually you can reach to a point and then give up everything and you don't want to go on on anything so you quit.
S05-C03-R05_036442-036595	No team works they encourage each others
S05-C03-R05_036595-036891	They learn more from the mistakes you feel that you learn
S05-C03-R05_036891-037245	Working individually there is no one to revise after you so you feel that you're sleeping actually.
S05-C03-R05_037768-038521	Most of the time English but it can be Arabic I like it I mean Arabic that is little Lebanon dialect or little far away than the Egyptian culture actually.
S05-C03-R05_038521-038908	Or the old movies that we get used to watch long time ago but now I'm not following.
S05-C03-R05_040187-040404	[HES] I mean English or Arabic?
S05-C03-R05_040404-040485	Anything?
S05-C03-R05_040606-040891	[HES] the most singer
S05-C03-R05_041014-041088	It can be Eminem
S05-C03-R05_041088-041652	Sometimes I was much listening to her because I like to enthusiasm myself during the training so I actually get used to that long time ago.
S05-C03-R05_041652-042411	[HES] Okay who else do I listen to my oh God? I listen to Fayrouz so much.
S05-C03-R05_044204-044740	About school no I don't think that I will enroll them in a national school because I was in a national school and there is no benefits.
S05-C03-R05_044740-044847	[HES]
S05-C03-R05_044847-045211	And then I saw people from international schools and I liked their way of thinking.
S05-C03-R05_045211-045717	It can be a German school.
S05-C03-R05_045717-046012	[HES] pardon me what is the question once more?
S05-C03-R05_046229-046715	What are you going to teach them when they start speak? which words would you teach them? and in which language?
S05-C03-R05_046715-047731	[HES] I will slightly go far away from the issue of teaching them words in a specific language besides the language you are using because it's the language they will first use. I mean later on they can understand second languages.
S05-C03-R05_047731-048282	So most of things are in Arabic I don't think so I mean when we get far away from this topic we will not force you actually.
S05-C03-R05_048282-049387	And that's it once they started to understand the languages they can understand more the meaning of the words and we can teach them the words in another language and the language that is not being used at home or the language that he can use at school or somewhere else.
S05-C03-R05_050181-051486	What I really want to do, I don't want to be an employee or I mean by income or to work in certain company and to take income per month sorry salary monthly and I mean currently I'm searching for being an entrepreneur.
S05-C03-R05_051486-052538	I took a courses in Entrepreneurship so as to know how to make start-up how to make it abroad or in country because I'm not sure about my status [HES] of course.
S05-C03-R05_052538-053107	But this is the point but my dream job it's no it's my dream company for example my dream organization more than dream job.
S05-C03-R05_053182-054315	Which field? [HES] at first I was thinking of web development because I took an experience from the internship and I took courses and so on.
S05-C03-R05_054315-054620	But lately I mean I didn't find this topic ..
S05-C03-R05_054784-054921	It was not my great interest
S05-C03-R05_054921-056143	So currently, I search and ask as well the major I enrolled in .. I enrolled in because of several factors [HES] it has several ways to learn several fields not only web development.
S05-C03-R05_056322-057000	The reason of my Bachelor I enrolled in a field that's totally different image processing to see the .. as well the work field how would it be like.
S05-C03-R05_057000-057177	But now there is a stage that I'm searching actually.
S05-C03-R05_058191-058855	[HES] I worked as a part-time for a while in the company I did before internship I did internship for three months.
S05-C03-R05_058855-059597	And the manager slightly liked my work and the supervisor so he proposed part-time job so I thought of trying it.
S05-C03-R05_059597-060193	Part-time job is the same as the internship it was the same eight hours five days per week.
S05-C03-R05_060193-060462	I used to go there at eight a.m.
S05-C03-R05_060462-060673	It was a company located in Dokki so it was slightly near to my house.
S05-C03-R05_060673-061487	[HES] I started to be like a tracker we adjust our schedule and so on actually.
S05-C03-R05_061487-061960	[HES] and continuously working I mean for example I used to work for example every hour I used to take a break a 15 minutes break.
S05-C03-R05_061960-062316	[HES] we ask each other more frequently it's not a desk job and that's it.
S05-C03-R05_062316-062714	But I mean I liked the job nature that was in the company.
S05-C03-R05_063817-063998	Yes, frankly as a student at college actually.
S05-C03-R05_063998-064867	Working life is something amazing it's beautiful but full of risks and then you're alone so if things messed up so body you have to handle it alone.
S05-C03-R05_064867-066430	So working life is definitely good, be of its advantages is that it's risky as well and you can get profit of course ; however, student life is a little bit lazy that you love .. learning bit by bit. I mean you still have have time to learn then go for the working life instead of rushing to the working life instantly
S05-C03-R05_067614-068137	[HES] I have tried working individually before at university and it was really exhausting and difficult
S05-C03-R05_068137-069243	I actually succeeded as I got certain grades for example or the project became very good. I'm proud of it but I was not pleased with the journey of the project. I am not pleased with the four month project.
S05-C03-R05_069243-070123	When I attended The internship and when I went the course, we used to take a lot of tutorials and everybody was sharing so I enjoyed that very much.
S05-C03-R05_070123-070890	Not all of us was working and there were so many problems but I felt that the team and I were supporting each other as they can explain everything to me .
S05-C03-R05_070890-071576	Until the situation became very disorganized, it was .. was a better experience rather than individual work
S05-C03-R05_072605-072754	Once before I had a partner in the team
S05-C03-R05_072754-073088	[HES] What I am trying the most is that once you had a break, you stopped working
S05-C03-R05_073088-073678	You don't have to exert much effort in order to reach something just stop and have a break
S05-C03-R05_073678-074290	You take it step-by-step restored with him too tackle the problem step by step simply at all all as if we are going to learn from the beginning as if you are kids
S05-C03-R05_074290-075494	Being simple makes you feel that you're not alone and it's okay to make mistakes and it's okay that you are not as the same level as the other people so you will start feeling some security then you have energy to continue
S05-C03-R05_075925-076170	Yes I have traveled before to Romania
S05-C03-R05_076170-076595	[HES] It was a camp .. camp for two weeks
S05-C03-R05_076967-077549	The camp was for two weeks as well [HES] the camp was sponsored by organization international organization
S05-C03-R05_077549-078047	The idea is that you go to this camp that has to do with swimming training that I used to attend.
S05-C03-R05_078047-078979	[HES] You go there to train people and teach them . In addition to this, they used to have a competition by the end with fourteen members from different countries and you started talking with them about the cultures there
S05-C03-R05_078979-079581	[HES] How do you live together? how do you eat? how do you earn money? what about your jobs?
S05-C03-R05_079581-079845	It is as if you got to know many countries
S05-C03-R05_081354-082321	There were a lot of places; for example, if I'm going to talk about the best place in Egypt, it will be Dahab, the Blue Hole or three pools
S05-C03-R05_082321-082977	[HES] Those were .. were great times as when we went there before, we spent .. spent three days alone in the camp
S05-C03-R05_082977-083610	[HES] So it was really good because it's one of the best places that I have ever seen, to be honest and I will not regret traveling the long road to go there
S05-C03-R05_083610-084037	The best place abroad? I can see that it was a really good because I have been to only one country
S05-C03-R05_084037-084969	The country that I traveled was all about forests so the experience was new for me as I haven't seen this before in Egypt at all so for me it was good and I will never forget it
S05-C03-R05_086651-086757	Of course I will travel
S05-C03-R05_086815-086890	Of course I will travel
S05-C03-R05_086890-088357	Traveling is nothing but when you want to travel and try new things, it's already an experience that helps you learn everything like how to manage your time how to manage your money and what you are going to spend on food. You will take spending money into consideration
S05-C03-R05_088357-089572	You get to know new people so your way of thinking will change for example you spent say twenty two or twenty three years with people that have the same mindset but when you go there, you will find that the society is not easily persuaded of anything that you say
S05-C03-R05_089572-089978	You should find a way to persuade them
S05-C03-R05_089978-090312	So the experience was really good, it's better not to miss such chance once you got it
S05-C03-R05_091246-092270	A turning point [HES] in my life? once there was something related to my father, yes, my father . He was in a coma and was suffering from some problems that I started to feel more responsible.
S05-C03-R05_092270-093803	He was in a coma for three months that I was responsible for his work and I had to deal with the problems there as .. I felt that I became more mature a little bit . It's not only about working but also leaving my family alone and being at university to finish that projects at university that I have there in addition to meeting my university colleagues so I felt that it would be better if I balanced between both of them
S05-C03-R05_093906-094136	It taught me how to balance between them and that's it
S05-C03-R05_095243-096162	It usually depends on the person in front of me. If I feel that the person in front of me really wants to talk with me and to ice break, I start talking with him freely but for me, I really like ice breaking . I don't like being isolated from people.
S05-C03-R05_096162-097407	I love talking with people freely and it's not necessarily to be right or wrong or, for example, or to be upset with me or angry from me but with all my respect, of course but I really like to get along with people so you should love this and learn how to do this.
S05-C03-R05_097407-098138	So I felt that I have .. I am educated, actually, I won't say that it's a gift but I am educated so I feel free to talk and it's okay with me no matter what as long as it's in a respectful way.
S05-C03-R05_099199-100507	I don't know what to say, yes but I should change my way of speaking, there's a special way you use when you deal with strangers unlike the way you use to deal with those you live with. So it will be different, of course but no I can talk with them but in a different way
S05-C03-R05_100507-101148	I mean if somebody that got used to me realized that I have totally changed my way with one hundred eighty degree so when he sees me, he will say that I am not used to speaking this way.
S05-C03-R05_101148-102215	Definitely, yes when I speak with another person so this is the way how I can let them understand my view point.So it depends. I shouldn't have only one way to let people understand my point.
S05-C03-R05_103417-103608	I will start with the good thing but I will laugh about the weird one at the end
S05-C03-R05_103608-103704	[HES]
S05-C03-R05_103704-104638	It's good for me a little bit. It's not about being courageous but rather about .. about being spontaneous as I say what I think at once as I don't even think about it or repeat those words
S05-C03-R05_104638-105017	So .. definitely, I am trying to do my best avoid this disadvantages this as much as I can
S05-C03-R05_105017-105644	But yes, I am very honest and I usually like meeting my friends
S05-C03-R05_105644-105827	I usually like checking on people even those who don't care
S05-C03-R05_105827-105954	I love checking on everyone
S05-C03-R05_105954-106263	I really love .. helping people
S05-C03-R05_106325-106908	It makes me internally pleased, it may be nonsense. I may not believe this but this is the truth.
S05-C03-R05_106937-107121	What I usually say is that I am a little bit honest
S05-C03-R05_107121-108087	Being honest is not .. not humiliating to the one in front of me.I mean if somebody did something wrong with me and I wanted to criticize him, I won't speak with him bluntly but it's totally the opposite as I will start speaking a step by step with him
S05-C03-R05_108087-108281	If I don't care about this person, it will not care.
S05-C03-R05_108281-108818	Something that's weird, that i am very silly
S05-C03-R05_110279-110616	Yes actually, i mean my Bachelor in particular
S05-C03-R05_110616-110693	My doctor
S05-C03-R05_110693-111242	Once I took such a start, he made me feel that I shouldn't do this at all as it's very trivial
S05-C03-R05_111242-111592	So once he said that it's trivial, I became in the mood
S05-C03-R05_111592-112474	But yes, it's because of the courses that we have at university and because of the doctors and TAs at university, you are forced to act like this way, to go freely in this path
S05-C03-R05_113006-113117	Yes, I can live without a mobile
S05-C03-R05_113309-114172	Actually, the mobile is not a great part of my life because I made myself busy doing other things, for example, as I said I usually read, as for my reading, I love the .. don't love the soft copies
S05-C03-R05_114172-114582	[HES] I train how to talk with people more
S05-C03-R05_114734-115732	As for the mobile part, if I want to contact with somebody who's far from me that I can't reach him, I can't meet him, I won't be able to speak with him this way that he was away or even if there's an emergency and he cannot come then he did his best to come
S05-C03-R05_116649-116860	A situation for example, or a specific idea, or what?
S05-C03-R05_117002-117106	To make you persuaded of this?
S05-C03-R05_117106-118006	[HES] if you have a shower with cold water everyday, will you lose weight.
S05-C03-R05_118190-119155	The idea that you take a shower with cold water may make you crazy, as nobody will take a cold shower but you will take a cold shower, okay?
S05-C03-R05_119155-120074	A step by step at first except that you feel as if you are dropped off from a plane or you went skydiving, it's really hard as you cannot breathe, you .. you cannot understand this
S05-C03-R05_120194-121300	You feel that it's easy for two or three minutes and everything is okay although the situation is difficult for example, you will jump from a plane, as you will make something great so you will feel great
S05-C03-R05_121300-122656	In this way, no, you feel that it's normal and that you can do anything like doing exercises, running, swimming or doing anything, your adrenaline will make you gain an experience .. you will feel wow so that you can do anything
S05-C03-R05_122656-123025	How to lose wait? As you will walk a lot and think and of course, you won't eat
S05-C03-R05_123227-123314	Try this
S05-C03-R05_123773-123935	You're most welcome
S07-C03-R07_001284-001505	Okay, I was born in Kuwait
S07-C03-R07_001505-001766	I lived there for eighteen years.
S07-C03-R07_001766-002033	Then I come to Egypt to join university
S07-C03-R07_002033-002509	I went to an international school
S07-C03-R07_002509-003021	I used to be in an IGs I mean just before I joined university
S07-C03-R07_003021-003388	Once I am done with IGs, I went to Egypt as soon as possible
S07-C03-R07_003388-003550	I came here in 2010
S07-C03-R07_003550-003945	And I have been living here on my own for nine years.
S07-C03-R07_005160-005558	Okay I thought that the first year at university was really difficult
S07-C03-R07_005558-006005	I wasn't actually sure which department department I wanted to join.
S07-C03-R07_006005-007000	Joining the faculty of engineering was mostly right because I am the only boy for my parents so I can't be anything other than an engineer or a doctor
S07-C03-R07_007000-007699	But given the circumstances and I am already the only boy so I had troubles dealing with people in general.
S07-C03-R07_007699-007832	I'm sort of introvert a little
S07-C03-R07_007832-008141	I felt that this is the most suitable field for me personally
S07-C03-R07_008141-008475	Because dealing with computers is a lot easier than dealing with human being
S07-C03-R07_008475-008731	[HUM]
S07-C03-R07_008731-009510	Actually, the social aspect in my life was minor and the component was very weak
S07-C03-R07_009510-010114	So I was not able to deal with people so it was more comfortable with dealing with computers
S07-C03-R07_010114-010337	So plus that I was good at it actually
S07-C03-R07_010337-011019	I mean I remember when I was in CS one, yes, I got B minus but but I used to explain to others
S07-C03-R07_011019-011339	May be the grades weren't fair due to the circumstances
S07-C03-R07_011339-011696	But in CS two I think I got an A easily actually
S07-C03-R07_012838-013651	Okay so I guess that my study was normalized normally like anybody else in my class
S07-C03-R07_013651-014161	I think it's all CS projects, except maybe for my Bachelor project
S07-C03-R07_014161-014746	My Bachelor project was about 3D object recognition which was something fancy actually at that time.
S07-C03-R07_014746-015484	Actually, yes, now the situation becomes easy but at that time in two thousand and fifteen, the project was a little bit difficult for me
S07-C03-R07_015484-016084	Actually, I spent more than two months and every day, I spend from twelve to sixteen hours in front of my laptop alone
S07-C03-R07_016084-016618	So I believe actually that it is one of the defining experiences in my life
S07-C03-R07_016618-017140	I felt that yes this is what hard work actually means
S07-C03-R07_017970-018611	My usual routine is that I feel as much as I can that I sleep seven hours as a block
S07-C03-R07_018611-018849	I don't my sleeping time
S07-C03-R07_018849-019216	I may spend a whole year taking three or four naps in total
S07-C03-R07_019216-020018	I really hate taking a nap in the middle of the day as I wake up suffering from headache. I don't like this so I try as much as I can to sleep for one block for seven hours, that's it
S07-C03-R07_020018-020231	If I sleep at eleven o'clock, I get up at five o'clock.
S07-C03-R07_020231-020565	If I sleep actually no sorry from eleven till five o'clock around six hours
S07-C03-R07_020565-020706	If I sleep at eleven o'clock, I get up at six o'clock.
S07-C03-R07_020706-021100	If I sleep at eleven o'clock, I get up at five o'clock and so on.
S07-C03-R07_021100-022847	But once I get up, obviously actually I read a few articles. Actually, once you get up, you are supposed to take a cold shower because this shock makes blood migrate into the inner organs rather than the outer organs.
S07-C03-R07_022847-023198	So it sort of gives you like a awake up call, it alerts you.
S07-C03-R07_023198-023582	Because your organs have entered a sort of hibernation state while you are asleep.
S07-C03-R07_023582-024509	So once you take a cold shower, water I mean blood flows into the organs out actually away from the skin cells
S07-C03-R07_024509-024737	So it actually works
S07-C03-R07_024809-025064	Actually the cold shower makes you awake
S07-C03-R07_025064-025936	But yes actually and as soon as I take my shower I just get my breakfast and come to uni or work actually
S07-C03-R07_027081-027445	Unfortunately I'm not a very sportive person
S07-C03-R07_027445-027867	So I watch TV series and this is the only thing I do in weekends
S07-C03-R07_027867-027962	That's it
S07-C03-R07_027962-028102	Actually Netflix mainly
S07-C03-R07_028757-029025	Okay, the last movie I have watched was Split
S07-C03-R07_029025-029161	I wanted to go and watch a movie called Glass
S07-C03-R07_029161-029724	I felt that I have watched unbreakable although it was very old movie that I watched long ago
S07-C03-R07_029724-029843	I really liked it
S07-C03-R07_029843-030518	And obviously Glass is based on Unbreakable and Split
S07-C03-R07_030518-030764	I watched Split and it was actually really interesting.
S07-C03-R07_030764-031305	Actually, the concept of multi-personality disorder is really really interesting.
S07-C03-R07_031305-031777	Actually when I watched YouTube videos that discuss a topic a little bit fancy topic
S07-C03-R07_031777-033400	As at one point, there was a woman that a man was asking her questions and she was replying having a certain attitude, tone and way after that with a few minutes exactly, he asked her the same question and she answered in a different way and the content of the answer is totally different
S07-C03-R07_033400-034289	Her tone of voice is totally different and the accent sort of even it becomes a little bit different as if she is Southern I mean the Southern States although she is not Southern at all
S07-C03-R07_034289-034430	Actually, it's a little bit creepy.
S07-C03-R07_034430-034838	So but actually it's an interesting movie
S07-C03-R07_035155-035212	Very interesting
S07-C03-R07_035974-036439	My favorite author or who I love reading for is Khaled El Husseiny
S07-C03-R07_036439-037405	The theme of Khaled ElHusseiny in general is just pain trauma which is painful drama actually which is the only thing that teaches human being honestly
S07-C03-R07_037405-038224	Actually all his books are good but maybe the book that influenced me the most was and the mountains echoed.
S07-C03-R07_038224-038348	I believe actually
S07-C03-R07_038348-038624	It was .. was a very gloomy book honestly
S07-C03-R07_039402-039770	Generally, the author is from an Afghan background
S07-C03-R07_039770-040409	He was a refugee actually and left Afghanistan and went to Pakistan then migrate to the US.
S07-C03-R07_040409-041152	So all his stories are themed around the refugees and the war that started in Afghanistan and so on.
S07-C03-R07_041152-042437	As the story tackles a character that lived during the war and actually how did she stumble upon one family to the other
S07-C03-R07_042437-042976	And then how the war influenced them although this woman was from a very wealthy family
S07-C03-R07_042976-043452	And how she went down and lived in a low state and it's really bad actually
S07-C03-R07_043452-043948	But and and how did she find I guess a true love
S07-C03-R07_043948-044593	Eventually, there should be the part of love and imaginary in order to make an entertaining story actually I guess
S07-C03-R07_046443-046951	I guess it depends on the geographical state that we will be in
S07-C03-R07_046951-047631	Actually, I'm not sure honestly as I should stay in Egypt or leave
S07-C03-R07_047631-047837	Actually, I'm not settled yet
S07-C03-R07_047837-048437	So it's assuming to travel another country so I'm guessing that any school will do
S07-C03-R07_048437-048775	Actually, there's a standard of education and there's not a great difference
S07-C03-R07_048775-049087	Most probably the majority of schools are almost the same thing
S07-C03-R07_049087-050038	Otherwise, if I am here in Egypt, I guess since that there is a great diversity in schools such as the experimental, international, national and the elite schools
S07-C03-R07_050038-050316	It's really very diverse and very difficult
S07-C03-R07_050316-050445	It's a very difficult choice
S07-C03-R07_050445-051186	So I guess personally that I choose the French schools for girls I guess
S07-C03-R07_051186-052381	Based on my personal experience, some of friends in my class are actually graduates of French and I felt that their education level, their level of education is really good and very satisfying at least
S07-C03-R07_052381-053526	So based on that based on my previous experience and what I noticed from my friends, I think that such schools will be most suited for my kids, I guess.
S07-C03-R07_054248-054959	Well, I'm guessing or actually I'm not guessing that being a TA is not my dream job
S07-C03-R07_054959-055202	I don't believe that it's anyone's dream job
S07-C03-R07_055202-055843	I personally try to acquire a position in an R and D.
S07-C03-R07_055843-056518	But the problem is on the R and D position I mean that the R and D requires the academia
S07-C03-R07_056518-056628	And I don't like the academia
S07-C03-R07_056628-056927	But it's a temporary state and it is a requirement
S07-C03-R07_056927-057656	So I'm trying to pass through this phase so that I can move on to an R and D for example it could be a corporate or it could be a research center institute.
S07-C03-R07_057656-057901	It shouldn't be related to the academia
S07-C03-R07_059107-059493	And the internships that I attended as I have attended an internship before in an oil company
S07-C03-R07_059493-059782	I used to work with the network administrator
S07-C03-R07_059782-061405	We used to try to set up sort of a network because they are IP cams it should all log in on the server so the owner of the company that lived in the US and he wanted to log in to see what's going in his company through his iPad so it was interesting
S07-C03-R07_061405-061877	Actually, I acquired a lot of knowledge about the networks in general based on this project.
S07-C03-R07_061877-062352	So this that was one interesting internship, honestly
S07-C03-R07_062352-062736	Actually, this actually from the little internships that I was forced to work on on my own and to deal with a lot of people
S07-C03-R07_062736-063512	Unlike the usual time you spend in your room using your laptop as you code your tasks and send emails and that's it
S07-C03-R07_065017-065257	I do not think that I want to be student anymore
S07-C03-R07_065257-065569	I'm actually I don't enjoy academic to be honest
S07-C03-R07_065569-065892	I'm not .. I don't enjoy teaching teaching process
S07-C03-R07_065892-066403	To me this is just a temporary phase with it as soon as possible and I'm trying to get done
S07-C03-R07_066403-066814	Being a student obviously would be something interesting if I'm learning something interesting
S07-C03-R07_066814-067670	Actually if I got a PhD position for something that I actually really like I'd definitely be interested to be a student once again actually
S07-C03-R07_067670-068789	But for the time being I'm looking for a job and such actually .. no I would like to go back to the market now actually
S07-C03-R07_070645-070930	I have traveled to so many places, honestly
S07-C03-R07_070930-071673	But the longest period of time I spent was in Holland Netherlands, I stayed there for a year
S07-C03-R07_071673-071968	I stayed in Germany for four months
S07-C03-R07_071968-072600	So I guess the most remarkable moment is when I .. was in the greenery actually
S07-C03-R07_072600-073010	Actually, I really lack this here in Cairo, honestly
S07-C03-R07_073010-074118	I remember one day when one of my friends visited me and we sat in front of Rijksmuseum that is the Rembrandt Museum
S07-C03-R07_074118-074373	Yes, the Rijksmuseum and the Rembrandt Museum are close to each other
S07-C03-R07_074373-074866	Anyways actually there's a greenery place and it's like a patch sort of hill
S07-C03-R07_074866-074966	But it's a made-up hill actually
S07-C03-R07_075042-075129	So we stayed there
S07-C03-R07_075129-075243	We stayed for three or four hours
S07-C03-R07_075243-075350	The weather was really good
S07-C03-R07_075350-075733	I think that that day was the most remarkable day for me in the whole year actually
S07-C03-R07_076736-076869	I made friends but not at work
S07-C03-R07_076869-077254	It's very difficult making friends at work
S07-C03-R07_077254-077859	I actually made more friends from the course of Deutsch that I used to study
S07-C03-R07_077859-078022	So that was pretty interesting
S07-C03-R07_078022-078347	I'm still in touch with some of them, not all of them obviously
S07-C03-R07_078347-078885	But I don't think that I make other friends
S07-C03-R07_078885-079203	Yes they were but they were with me at the Dutch Course
S07-C03-R07_079890-080342	On the top of my mind right now actually I would love to go to Japan, honestly
S07-C03-R07_080342-080493	To me, it's a very interesting place
S07-C03-R07_080493-080969	Actually, I think I would love to go to Japan anytime soon.
S07-C03-R07_080969-081375	That next to Switzerland as well
S07-C03-R07_081375-081690	Actually, I've always looked forward to visiting Switzerland
S07-C03-R07_081690-082396	But definitely the price tag of each trip, no matter how little it is, it becomes bigger honestly so it's something to think twice about actually
S07-C03-R07_084448-084699	It depends on the scholarship itself
S07-C03-R07_084699-085238	It depends on the position that's offered actually and the scholarship that's an offer as well
S07-C03-R07_085238-086762	I am guessing obviously a scholarship is something nice to have and a position is obviously something to seek for whether or not this is something suitable to me right now that it's a very difficult decision actually and that's it
S07-C03-R07_088011-088885	[HUM] [BREATH] I guess there were a lot of turning points
S07-C03-R07_088885-090000	But I believe maybe the first six months after work was the turning point in my life as I felt that I'm no longer a child actually
S07-C03-R07_090000-090188	Actually, I'm an adult and I'm responsible for myself
S07-C03-R07_090188-090976	And it's .. the stress at work was really violent at that time of my life in particular so I felt that okay actually this is the difficult choice to make
S07-C03-R07_090976-091198	That are you happy?
S07-C03-R07_091198-091984	If so are you I mean is there something you can do to make you more happy or less unhappy?
S07-C03-R07_091984-092271	So I believe that's one of the turning points
S07-C03-R07_093352-093933	Okay I, as a student, I personally prefer working individually not in group projects
S07-C03-R07_093933-094218	But now that I worked I believe that it became different
S07-C03-R07_094218-094823	And I really appreciate the group work
S07-C03-R07_094823-095424	However I would always prefer that the task given to me is not a task that I need to do for somebody
S07-C03-R07_095424-096425	Actually, assuming that there are pools of tasks so assign to me tasks as many tasks as you want and I submit those tasks to you so as he can continue working on the tasks or he adds this to another part
S07-C03-R07_096425-096639	He and I will not be working on the same task
S07-C03-R07_096639-097274	Actually assuming that if there are a presentation or a report that need to be made, I can be responsible for the presentation and he will be responsible for the report or vice versa
S07-C03-R07_097274-097551	It's not necessary to work on the presentation together or to work on the report together
S07-C03-R07_097551-097745	I feel that's counter-productive actually
S07-C03-R07_098986-099115	There are but outside university
S07-C03-R07_099115-099465	I believe that my personal role model right now is Elon Musk
S07-C03-R07_099465-099826	He is that kind of person who wakes up at 4 am actually
S07-C03-R07_099826-099974	Because he is the one who made Space X
S07-C03-R07_099974-100061	He is the one who made Paypal
S07-C03-R07_100061-100398	He is the one who made Tesla
S07-C03-R07_100398-100884	So so .. yes this is definitely something I look up to actually
S07-C03-R07_102836-103868	I believe you can never actually target the .. or actually tackle the idea of liking someone or loving someone no matter how good you are as a person either be .. actually you'll always be criticized in a way
S07-C03-R07_103868-104793	So if we will talk about the personal sorry the professional perspective and career-wise I believe I'd rather be respected than liked
S07-C03-R07_104793-105923	Yes, being loved among your colleagues at work is obviously something that you would love to find and something that you would seek but it's impossible
S07-C03-R07_105923-106237	You will never be loved by all your colleagues at work
S07-C03-R07_106237-106388	It's almost impossible
S07-C03-R07_106388-106716	So I'd rather be liked, honestly
S07-C03-R07_106716-106883	Get things done faster
S07-C03-R07_107983-108344	I believe that no I'm not an approachable person at all
S07-C03-R07_108344-108576	Actually I'm not an easy person to deal with at all
S07-C03-R07_108576-108970	But at work actually as long as we are at work yes it's simple and easy
S07-C03-R07_108970-109764	But as for the personal level no, I take a lot of time to come on to someone and just actually be natural with them actually
S07-C03-R07_109764-110276	So there are always a lot of layers before dealing with a normal person as he's somebody I have known since ages
S07-C03-R07_111337-111417	Indecisiveness
S07-C03-R07_111417-111570	I hate indecisive people
S07-C03-R07_111570-113182	[HUM] I don't like for example the concept of having a meeting no so let's all decide no we can do A or we can say that we will do B or it could be C, which is okay this is not going to work
S07-C03-R07_113182-113641	So it's okay as all these options are on the table but we need to make a decision
S07-C03-R07_113641-114152	That if you are indifferent and passive to everything I mean then we might not have this meeting
S07-C03-R07_114152-114317	Actually, I feel that it's pointless
S07-C03-R07_116845-117006	But not at university
S07-C03-R07_117006-117700	I'm sure that I've done this once or twice within an interview which I think is allowed, i mean, in an interview.
S07-C03-R07_117700-117901	But I don't do this inside the class
S07-C03-R07_117901-118604	Actually once when one of one of the students asks me if I don't I mean if something .. I mean if somebody asks me whether I know this or not, I tell him.
S07-C03-R07_118604-119231	No and when I was .. no during the evaluation yes when I was a student yes when I was having evaluations definitely
S07-C03-R07_119231-119335	Yes I definitely
S07-C03-R07_119335-119423	Exactly actually
S07-C03-R07_119423-119566	I definitely had to do that
S07-C03-R07_119566-120072	But now, as a teacher, no, I definitely don't do that
S07-C03-R07_120072-120446	Actually when somebody asks whether I know this or not, I say no and I ask him to send me an email then I will reply with the answers as soon as possible.
S07-C03-R07_121331-122166	I guess in the evaluations I remember in particular actually when there were many situations, it definitely did help me up
S07-C03-R07_122166-123269	Actually it means that if I spoke about the project and how much effort I exert and what to-do-list I prepare regarding this class and the other class and I guess that it worked eventually actually
S07-C03-R07_123269-123655	Not proud of it but it did happen honestly yes.
S07-C03-R07_124312-125009	No because the majority of people that I deal with on daily basis are not there around me
S07-C03-R07_125009-125578	Actually my parents live outside Egypt so I will never be able to communicate with them if I don't have a mobile
S07-C03-R07_125578-125734	It's almost impossible actually
S07-C03-R07_126227-127102	I think that one of the most important points that people skip or don't care about is sleeping seven hours
S07-C03-R07_127102-127726	Actually, this is that you have no idea how much research shows actually actually very very important for a human being
S07-C03-R07_127726-128493	I mean as much as that people stop growing after twenty-five and that you are already after twenty-five it's a countdown for you to die basically
S07-C03-R07_128493-128790	But sleeping seven hours is .. is so vital
S07-C03-R07_128790-130924	Actually research shows that sleeping less than seven hours will actually actually I mean .. will actually most probably lead to elevated heart beat so the blood pressure will rise, you'll be susceptible to the slightest things happening at work actually, so you will be passive-aggressive, you will be overweight easily
S07-C03-R07_130924-132317	Definitely, I'm not exactly sure what I am not sure of casualty and effect in everything, actually how each one happens, but actually I'm sure that I've read a research that shows that all of this happens if you sleep less than seven hours
S07-C03-R07_132317-132800	So I feel that one of the underrated things is that somebody sleeps less than seven hours
S07-C03-R07_132800-133308	I'm sure that you don't want to lose weight at one point and you don't want to suffer from high blood pressure at any point in time soon
S07-C03-R07_133308-134024	So If you want to avoid these two things you definitely need exactly or more than seven hours .. actually to sleep less than seven hours as a block actually.
S09-C03-R09_001455-001706	Actually, I was born here in Cairo here in Egypt
S09-C03-R09_001706-002371	I used to be at traditional national schools and all of them are Arabic before university
S09-C03-R09_002371-002810	Then I joined GUC, then when I was graduated from GUC, I became a TA
S09-C03-R09_002810-003416	I was at university, then I worked as a TA at the same university where I used to study till now
S09-C03-R09_005190-006185	[HES] I started to be .. interested in my .. my major starting from semester 3 at university although at the beginning totally against it, I didn't want to go for this major at all
S09-C03-R09_006185-006621	Starting from semester three, I felt that I am more interested rather than the other majors
S09-C03-R09_006621-007124	And starting from semester three I decided that I will continue in this major until I graduate, God Willing
S09-C03-R09_007124-007455	My Bachelor project is about something entitled semantic web
S09-C03-R09_007455-008583	Most of the search engines there were .. were working on their .. their .. their logic based on the linguistic part that the user enter regardless of its meaning and what he means by this
S09-C03-R09_008583-009918	We used to try to make a semantic search engine that reasons or understands the user that writes a term in the .. the search engine and what he means by that trying to show the best results that can fit the .. the term or the query that the user entered
S09-C03-R09_010645-010962	I do nothing except for getting up, having breakfast and getting dressed
S09-C03-R09_012299-013519	So basically the weekend is just for resting and sleeping and the .. the extra thing that can be done is to visit my .. family, relatives and so on, that's it
S09-C03-R09_014190-014907	My hobbies are mostly reading and the .. the .. the computer games, if I can call it a hobby, that's it
S09-C03-R09_016102-016801	[HES] maybe I read a lot of books and all of them are good
S09-C03-R09_016801-017542	[HES] most of them were novels actually they are not .. not .. not scientific books or something
S09-C03-R09_017542-018962	A novel entitled Morning and Evening talk by Naguib Mahfouz was one of my favorites, and when I watched the .. dramatic adaptation as it was adapted into a series or something and it was adapted in a very well presentation
S09-C03-R09_018962-019754	[HES] there was The Prisoner of Zenda and it was also very well.
S09-C03-R09_019754-020462	[HES] and actually, the second part that most people don't know that it has a second part that was entitled Rupert of Hentzau
S09-C03-R09_020462-020710	It was the second part of The Prisoner of Zenda
S09-C03-R09_020796-020938	Those what I can still remember for now
S09-C03-R09_020938-021111	Those what I really liked the most
S09-C03-R09_022112-023483	I haven't watched movies in a long time, but the movies that I watched that were very impactful on me were Troy and most of Harry Potter series when i used to watch them when i was young
S09-C03-R09_023483-024000	Titanic [HES] when I watched it for the first time.
S09-C03-R09_024000-025919	At that time the .. the directing of the movie was very persuasive of its exact message . Even if this is opposite to what you are persuaded of, he can direct you to the idea that he wants to say exactly and who you sympathize with, who you don't sympathize with, who you love, who you hate, you see the movie in his own eyes exactly like what he wants actually
S09-C03-R09_025919-026266	[HES] those what I can remember now
S09-C03-R09_026266-026468	I don't remember anything else actually
S09-C03-R09_026908-026995	Yes
S09-C03-R09_029631-030222	I still don't have children but in general I didn't .. didn't think of a specific school
S09-C03-R09_030222-031191	It's not about being an international or a national school but it's based on the school itself and the .. the .. the environment over all that the .. that the son will be there one day
S09-C03-R09_031191-031722	It's not necessarily that a national school is bad or that the international school is very good but no it depends on the school itself
S09-C03-R09_031722-032264	It has .. actually has certain standards that one will think of at that time I mean to make sure that there's a healthy environment around him
S09-C03-R09_032264-033091	And students like him should have certain standards as such standards I want my child to learn from school
S09-C03-R09_033091-033982	As for the languages, he should have the.the .. the secondary language based on the school no matter is it English, French or Deutsch, no problem
S09-C03-R09_033982-035542	But what I am really interested in is that .. he didn't abandon his mother tongue which is Arabic, no he should know Arabic well and he should speak Arabic and discuss everything in Arabic but still he has a secondary language that's very strong that will help him scientifically or anything related to the job market or something
S09-C03-R09_036437-036678	In the software development
S09-C03-R09_037856-038141	No the .. the working life is better for me by far
S09-C03-R09_038141-039396	I don't .. don't .. don't want to be as a student anymore or to have the .. the .. the hassle of attending lectures and solving assignments and .. and exams and midterms and things like that I don't .. don't to go back to this ever
S09-C03-R09_039396-040189	Even the time when I was working on the Masters here when I was a kind of a student was not .. not .. not a good time at all actually.
S09-C03-R09_040189-041373	All the activities that are a kind of student activities when it comes to readings and getting papers to find out something and things like that was really bad for me and I don't like to go back to this kind of activities again.
S09-C03-R09_044224-045500	Definitely, if it's based on routine, it could be long term very boring daily routine .. but if you enjoy it, it will reduce the chances of feeling bored with what you do throughout the day especially that it's like teaching.
S09-C03-R09_045500-046921	As for teaching, each semester, you meet new people and interact with them differently according to their different mentalities that you need to address all of these mentalities differently in order to deliver your message or to deliver your content in a good way to these students
S09-C03-R09_046921-048949	So at least I really love teaching and I feel that it's a kind of challenge, first of all whatever the level of students in front of you, you should deliver what you want to say in whatever way as you should find a way through which they can understand what you say as well as the content that you need to deliver to them correctly and in an efficient way so that they understand you regardless it's technically good or, it's not technically good
S09-C03-R09_048949-049215	So this kind of challenge .. satisfies me honestly
S09-C03-R09_049215-049415	That I %b .. try to overcome it in a way or another
S09-C03-R09_049415-050196	Socially, you pass by so many people of different mentalities, from different environments, from different levels so I see that's good
S09-C03-R09_050196-050980	[HES] by time although I didn't like the .. the .. the .. the student life, the GUC is a comfort zone for me
S09-C03-R09_050980-051410	So therefore I don't mind at all to stay here even if there's a routine-based aspect
S09-C03-R09_052677-053159	Once when I was in the eighth semester, I was in an internship at the software development company
S09-C03-R09_053159-053701	[HES] as for our .. our .. our normal life, we were divided into teams there
S09-C03-R09_053701-054326	Each team was responsible for a part of a product that they made with .. with different teams that were there
S09-C03-R09_054326-055135	I was in the team of the development there and we used to practice on the developing .. developing software with language C++
S09-C03-R09_055135-056400	[HES] It was .. was a very good experience for me, I could feel how people were working on the software development and it was actually one of my preferable parts for me although I became a TA after that but I was very pleased with
S09-C03-R09_056400-057145	And if I get the chance later on, God willing, to .. to shift my career to something related to software development I .. I wouldn't mind at all ..
S09-C03-R09_057603-057697	No
S09-C03-R09_058466-058730	Last time I went to North Coast last summer
S09-C03-R09_058730-059035	It's only leisure time actually
S09-C03-R09_059035-059514	One can go there, wake up, go to the .. the beach, then come back and eat, sleep and so on, nothing more
S09-C03-R09_060764-061062	[HES] This is surprising for some people but it's Marsa Matrouh
S09-C03-R09_061133-062269	[HES] the .. the .. the environment there was really good, the sea was really good, calm and clean and the landscapes that look naturally were nice in addition to so many places that you can visit such as museums and so on
S09-C03-R09_062269-062687	[HES] In general, the weather there is better than that in other places that I visited
S09-C03-R09_062687-062937	And .. and I have no problem to go there once, twice, thrice
S09-C03-R09_065004-065574	The first turning point was in semester three when I decided to continue in the major CS
S09-C03-R09_065574-066351	Because before this %b .. %b .. the .. the decisions for me were far away from CS, it was electronics or mechatronics for example or something
S09-C03-R09_066351-066803	As the turning point that the course of CS3 and that was the turning point for me
S09-C03-R09_066803-067946	Because I felt that I really enjoy this .. this and I really excel things like computer science and at the same time things related to the other major like circuits and things like that that I .. I did miserably in these courses actually
S09-C03-R09_067946-068417	So a huge turning point was when I choose a major and go for another major at all
S09-C03-R09_068417-068748	[HES] the same happens before I joined university
S09-C03-R09_068748-069477	At the beginning I was about to join another university then by mere chance one of my friends told me about the GUC
S09-C03-R09_069477-070142	And I had .. had an impression about the GUC because it's GUC but the other place that I was about to go required a specific language
S09-C03-R09_070241-070613	Because that was the language there and I don't know this language
S09-C03-R09_070613-071165	But I knew from him that the .. the university doesn't require having a specific language so I can join it anyways
S09-C03-R09_071165-071479	So by chance, I went there and took the test and I passed the test
S09-C03-R09_071479-071562	Then I joined GUC
S09-C03-R09_071562-071861	It was swingy at all actually
S09-C03-R09_072931-073345	[HES] maybe not at all
S09-C03-R09_073345-074138	Actually i have like a kind of standards and kind of a goal that I try to pursue in my own way regardless of how other people did it previously
S09-C03-R09_075170-075526	No I I would say that I am very very easy person to deal with
S09-C03-R09_075526-076309	On the contrary, I'm a very considering person as I try to understand the person in front of me and know how he speaks and deal with him in the same way that he uses to interact with me
S09-C03-R09_077651-078072	Yes I feel that I need to change the way I deal with people in general but I don't feel that it's difficult
S09-C03-R09_078072-078390	On the contrary, I feel that it's part of the social intelligence actually
S09-C03-R09_078390-078986	And this is a skill as far as I think people should have this skill in particular especially that if you interact with different levels of people
S09-C03-R09_079615-079972	And I have to deal with all of these students in a good way
S09-C03-R09_079972-080587	It's not necessary to be in a specific level and I prefer this level and if somebody is away from this level, I don't deal with him in a good way.
S09-C03-R09_080587-080911	On the contrary I don't feel that's difficult
S09-C03-R09_080911-081531	Yes, it's important to change the way how he deals with different persons and different personalities and so on but I don't feel that's difficult actually
S09-C03-R09_082568-082994	No I prefer to be respected rather than liked
S09-C03-R09_082994-083601	I am not interested to be liked or not liked but rather respected because respect comes over love
S09-C03-R09_083601-083874	You may love somebody very much but by the end he won't respect him
S09-C03-R09_083874-084422	He sees him .. loves him because he does something that he likes but the overall picture I see is that he is not a respectful person
S09-C03-R09_084422-085357	The .. the respect can be found even if the person doesn't like you, or he doesn't accept you because of something else but overall to gain his respect is not easy at all rather than to be liked
S09-C03-R09_085357-085560	Maybe you are liked for illegal reasons
S09-C03-R09_085560-085835	You may be liked for [HES] inappropriate reasons
S09-C03-R09_085835-086429	That you do something that he sees it as a good thing after all as he sees that he does not gain his respect
S09-C03-R09_086429-086920	That to gain a respect of someone is more important than to be liked
S09-C03-R09_088351-088605	Yes, it could be but I don't make it as a dead end
S09-C03-R09_088605-088836	If there's a chance, I will try, if not, I won't try to deal with him again
S09-C03-R09_088836-089654	But the .. the .. the stubborn person is the one who sticks to a certain viewpoint and he shapes everything around
S09-C03-R09_089654-090398	So dealing with these kind of people is very very difficult and no matter how often you try once, twice or thrice, most probably you don't reach anything
S09-C03-R09_090398-090718	But at some point I am trying not to close the door
S09-C03-R09_090718-091286	No there's at least a chance as we can make an extra trial with him maybe he will start being more flexible actually
S09-C03-R09_093318-093473	I have .. have never done this at all
S09-C03-R09_093473-094245	On the contrary, most of the interviews that I attended and I say everything very very very honestly as I told them that I really didn't know that topic and that I cannot answer this question
S09-C03-R09_094245-095583	Although people advise me to avoid showing that you don't understand but I would prefer to speak about something that I do understand rather than fabricate the answer saying nonsense just to try .. to impress them with something that they don't even know so he would say this .. this .. this is good and I pass it but I don't .. don't do that
S09-C03-R09_095583-096221	Okay what was the reaction of the person in front of you the interviewer? What was his reaction? Or what did he tell you? Did he remain silent did you remain silent?
S09-C03-R09_096221-096709	It happened twice, once he didn't give any impression at all, as for the second time he was surprised because I said so.
S09-C03-R09_096709-097239	He was surprised because I .. I said that I didn't know and that the one who had an interview said that he didn't know this topic
S09-C03-R09_097286-097820	But by the way in .. in both interviews I got accepted
S09-C03-R09_097944-098349	But I got accepted and that they didn't reject me because I said that I didn't understand that topic
S09-C03-R09_098870-099120	Honestly I doubt
S09-C03-R09_099120-099841	Unfortunately, I can feel this unfortunately actually our .. our .. our lifestyle is based on the mobile and internet mainly
S09-C03-R09_099841-100028	So the mobile means to have internet everywhere
S09-C03-R09_100028-100161	You have your mobile everywhere
S09-C03-R09_100161-100756	You can do a lot using your internet as you can check the news and social media through it and so on
S09-C03-R09_100756-102024	One can feel that when the internet connection is weak, or when there's no internet at all no I feel that I stay in .. in .. in .. in a black hole that I cannot interact with people around me or I don't know what's happening
S09-C03-R09_102024-102439	This is not good but as far I think most of the life style of people now is like that
S09-C03-R09_102439-102828	Actually no, I can say that I cannot live without internet or mobile
S09-C03-R09_104210-105235	I would say [HES] that you don't .. don't do anything if your major is computer science, don't do any research if you don't want to continue in a research track
S09-C03-R09_105235-106463	As for the major of computer science, most of the .. the job market don't appreciate whatever in a research track especially if it's not practical, it won't benefit them at work
S09-C03-R09_106463-107271	If you are about to work in the software development company part one, two or three, they will check your skills that have to do with the job duties
S09-C03-R09_107271-107477	What will they be able to take from you at work?
S09-C03-R09_107477-108479	But if you say that you worked on Masters in a certain field and you prepared a paper to attend a conference and that you applied for a journal and that was a .. a .. a .. a .. very impactful journal and so on
S09-C03-R09_108479-108708	It's okay with all of this and then, what will you do at work?
S09-C03-R09_108708-109527	So if you decided at the beginning that you want to continue the academic career, I would rather say do not try to pursue this field at all
S09-C03-R09_109527-109737	Or even you try to say that you'll complete Masters and then go
S09-C03-R09_109737-109983	Most probably you will complete Masters for your own sake
S09-C03-R09_109983-111526	But if you target target the job market from day one anything that would lead you to the job market even if it's a very small start-up or anything that will offer you an experience and to .. to .. to .. to .. to .. to support your CV regarding what you especially are pursuing in the field of computer science
S09-C03-R09_111526-113224	But if you feel that you are an academic person and that you want to continue the academic career then you'll be a TA then a doctor then a professor and so on, no you have to go this way and you know what you need in order to continue in this track successfully actually
S10-C03-R10_001959-002161	I was born in Cairo anyways
S10-C03-R10_002161-003035	First, I live in Gesr El Suez then I moved into ElRehab then I moved into Nasr City then I went back to ElRehab
S10-C03-R10_003035-003679	[HES] I went to two .. three schools as well
S10-C03-R10_003679-003860	When I was in the KG, I was at ..
S10-C03-R10_003963-004524	When I was in the KG, I went to a school and I moved to another school in the primary stage then I moved to a third school in the preparatory and secondary stages
S10-C03-R10_004524-004955	[HES] all of them where national but English schools actually
S10-C03-R10_004955-005356	But after that I joined university
S10-C03-R10_006800-007381	First of all, I joined university so as to go for mechatronics or production, okay?
S10-C03-R10_007381-008260	And then at first I was a little bit hesitated whether I would go for electronics or networks but I joined mechatronics as well
S10-C03-R10_008260-008913	But after I joined mechatronics, I discovered that I am good at the subjects that related to .. CS actually
S10-C03-R10_008913-009356	That is CS or .. or .. or any other subjects related to electricity
S10-C03-R10_009396-009938	But for the .. the mechanical subjects that I used to .. to pass but I got C minus or C
S10-C03-R10_009938-010853	So I decided that I said no [HES] I will try think on my own about this so I said if I left CS, what would happen
S10-C03-R10_010853-011272	I was about to be in semester four so anyways I should repeat four subjects and so on
S10-C03-R10_011272-012164	But when I was at the end of the semester, I decided that no I should be careful while making this decision so as not to regret it later on and I moved to MET
S10-C03-R10_012164-012522	I thought that I was only one department until they told me that there are departments for DMET and CS
S10-C03-R10_012522-012803	Why did I go for DMET?
S10-C03-R10_012803-013040	I can't remember to be honest with you
S10-C03-R10_013040-013356	I really cannot remember why I went for DMET instead of CS
S10-C03-R10_013356-013649	But actually I didn't regret taking this decision
S10-C03-R10_014236-014347	No, I don't usually regret
S10-C03-R10_015378-016145	Okay now actually .. actually I devote my time to three aspects
S10-C03-R10_016145-016812	It's university or Bachelor a, training and the third is something called hyperloop
S10-C03-R10_016812-017073	At Cairo university that I have just joined recently
S10-C03-R10_017073-017537	Most probably my day is divided upon these three or it's for only one of them
S10-C03-R10_017537-017969	I mean for example I get up no I get up now whenever I want at 12 pm for example
S10-C03-R10_017969-018727	But I either go to university or stay at home to work on the Bachelor and at night I go to the training three times a week
S10-C03-R10_019647-020601	Now on Friday I go and exercise American football almost every Friday as I watch matches or if I don't go there, I hang out with my friends anyways
S10-C03-R10_021791-022231	[HES] Okay not really actually
S10-C03-R10_022231-022704	Actually, there's no exercise but this the most that ..
S10-C03-R10_022868-023793	Regardless that I go to the training, even when I stay at home I go and search .. search to learn more about this topic by watching videos and reading about the rules and that's it
S10-C03-R10_024777-025011	Okay first of all, the Bachelor
S10-C03-R10_025011-025606	It started that I .. I am supposed to do something called tracking objects using something called stereo camera
S10-C03-R10_025606-026162	Stereo camera is an ordinary camera but they .. they are actually two cameras okay?
S10-C03-R10_026162-027647	So it's being used instead now if we use a specific camera okay to know the distance between the camera and the other thing, if it's only one camera it will work but with .. with estimation
S10-C03-R10_027647-028718	Actually for example if you know that .. this person's average density is so and he can see his weight so he will estimate the distance between the camera and the other thing
S10-C03-R10_028718-029722	But if we have a stereo camera and in certain ways we can use it to estimate the distance between the camera and the specific two objects this way, okay?
S10-C03-R10_029722-030120	That by using two cameras so it's related to Maths and so on but I didn't go into it
S10-C03-R10_030120-030466	But I totally changed it until it becomes something else [LAUGHTER]
S10-C03-R10_030466-031712	At first [COUGH] I was trying to .. to detect the object in general and to find out how I can know that's only one object so that I can estimate this region that this particular object has nothing to do with the surroundings
S10-C03-R10_031712-032321	So I went for deep learning and computer vision and so on I am still reading in this topic
S10-C03-R10_032321-032761	Hyperloop is totally different it's .. [COUGH]
S10-C03-R10_032761-033086	Do you know Elon Musk?
S10-C03-R10_033247-033608	Okay actually if you know Elon Musk and if you know Space X or Tesla?
S10-C03-R10_033698-034052	Okay he is the owner of those two companies, he is the founder of those two companies
S10-C03-R10_034052-034245	Then he made something called hyperloop
S10-C03-R10_034245-035673	Such hyperloop is like a transportation method as it looks like a closed tube and it has low pressure like the vacuum and the pods pass through it to transport people from one place to another
S10-C03-R10_035673-037564	It's like a train but without wheels actually as it is moving on something called air cushion actually the air is pushing it downwards so that there will be a distance between it and the ground and it moves with very high speeds because there's no drag force maybe because the pressure is 0.1 percent from the atmospheric pressure
S10-C03-R10_037564-038455	So it moves with very high speed and with low cost because the tube is placed above the solar panels so it powers itself in general
S10-C03-R10_038455-039358	So .. and the user of the motor that they use is the same as the motor that is in Tesla which is an electric motor .. motor so there's no fuel consumption.
S10-C03-R10_039358-041259	The important part is that they made a competition for students to let them .. them participate as they should build pod but a little bit smaller and .. we travel to perform actually the pod that is performed in .. in America in a certain place that we still don't know
S10-C03-R10_041259-042681	And we are trying actually they are trying to see the best one who created the breaking system and the best one to maintain safety and so on and even they evaluate it according to many aspects so we are still making a team and so on
S10-C03-R10_043095-043307	[HES] no [LAUGHTER]
S10-C03-R10_043743-043860	No [LAUGHTER]
S10-C03-R10_044141-044226	I do love movies.
S10-C03-R10_045300-045666	My most favorite movie is Dark Knight Rises
S10-C03-R10_045666-046067	It's about Batman of course all people know it
S10-C03-R10_046114-046430	Should I tell the events of the movie?
S10-C03-R10_046670-048983	A brief story is that [LAUGHTER] that Batman wasn't there for a long time at .. at generally actually for reason that was in the previous movie and .. and but he was forced to come back because there's somebody actually was about to come and he wanted to .. to turn the whole city where he stayed upside down
S10-C03-R10_048983-049240	That's it and he beat him at the end and there was a war
S10-C03-R10_049240-049401	It was a very good movie [LAUGHTER]
S10-C03-R10_050578-051217	Honestly, I still don't .. don't care about the job but I do care about the place
S10-C03-R10_051217-052139	Actually, I wanted to go to a country .. some countries where I wish to live so whoever will come with me should understand me?
S10-C03-R10_053446-053563	Unfortunately, no
S10-C03-R10_055449-056207	Honestly, each has its comfortable aspects actually at university, I was free sometimes but this is not the case with working definitely
S10-C03-R10_056207-057077	[HES] I would work to be independent and this is the good point that I am looking forward to
S10-C03-R10_057421-057575	I have traveled twice
S10-C03-R10_058517-058909	Okay first I traveled to Sweden in two thousand and thirteen
S10-C03-R10_058909-059213	I was playing handball with my team
S10-C03-R10_059213-059506	We stayed there for two weeks
S10-C03-R10_059506-060552	The best was the .. the championship where we participated and we found many people there because they liked the handball actually they can go and watch the match in the stadium and so on
S10-C03-R10_060552-060984	So the championship was an important event in the city there
S10-C03-R10_060984-063154	So the first thing is the great diversity actually there were teams from different countries in the world as all of them were almost in that place. In addition to this, people who were living there attended the matches and a great number was .. and the opening celebration for example the stadium was totally full not with not only the teams but also people .. people who were living there
S10-C03-R10_063154-064062	It was like .. a festival in the streets all the time as there were a lot of people who were .. were living there
S10-C03-R10_064062-064384	Second I have been to Saudi Arabia for Umrah
S10-C03-R10_067021-067249	I which I can live abroad
S10-C03-R10_068180-068584	First Canada or Australia
S10-C03-R10_068584-069914	Canada and Australia in the first place. Canadians don't exercise .. racism as they have morals so they will welcome everyone
S10-C03-R10_069914-070587	Actually people there I don't feel that .. that I am not welcomed there and I can feel that I am a stranger
S10-C03-R10_070587-070953	In addition to this, there are Arabs there in every where
S10-C03-R10_070953-071373	In Australia .. Australia .. life is a little bit easy
S10-C03-R10_071373-071739	Actually working there is not that difficult for them
S10-C03-R10_071739-071903	Their minimum wage is high
S10-C03-R10_071903-072453	Actually even if I .. I go to Australia for example I have no problem with working anything that doesn't relate to my major
S10-C03-R10_072453-072901	I could work as bus driver I have no problem with that
S10-C03-R10_072901-073299	It's important to have an experience to live abroad in a country like that
S10-C03-R10_076129-077007	No I just felt that I don't want to .. to continue in a field that I am not sure about and that happened when I was in mechatronics actually
S10-C03-R10_077007-078140	I didn't want to regret making this decision after graduation then I would say that I should or .. or that I meet somebody to tell me to join mechatronics and I would say no as I .. joined mechatronics but I wish I could joined another department
S10-C03-R10_078140-079574	No .. no I didn't like to go for .. for this even if .. even if I changed the major and then graduated, I wouldn't like this. If I had remained in mechatronics, I wouldn't have known that it was a mistake
S10-C03-R10_079574-079984	It's okay I have no problem with that I don't regret anything like that
S10-C03-R10_080849-082448	Honestly, the experience with the team wasn't that good .. no but in some cases the team .. was good in general . To me, I have no problem with both options honestly because in both cases, I would work on tasks individually
S10-C03-R10_082448-082943	As well I have no problem to help someone else even if it's not my part actually.
S10-C03-R10_082943-083118	I have no problem
S10-C03-R10_084029-084335	Yes Elon Musk
S10-C03-R10_085144-087241	That he will change everything now like the global warming that .. things like that are dangerous for the .. environment in general the global warming is like the .. how I can call it?
S10-C03-R10_087241-088194	In general it .. it .. is related to .. to fossil the burning of fossil fuels actually as it .. it was the most important part in his life
S10-C03-R10_088194-089081	Actually he .. dedicated .. his life for this and in general he is a very successful person
S10-C03-R10_089081-089325	I wish I could be like him one day
S10-C03-R10_091318-091525	Of course to be liked is better
S10-C03-R10_092949-093711	No no I am a very easy person and it's okay I have no problem actually it's not annoying to talk with people
S10-C03-R10_094917-095169	Yes.sometimes I deal with them ..
S10-C03-R10_095248-097192	Actually maybe I .. somehow I stereotype this as if I find the person in front of me is from .. from a certain type that I got used to deal with, I will deal with him according to this concept even if he is not like that, it means that I still don't know him but I am just assuming
S10-C03-R10_098611-099727	The best quality that I see about myself is that I don't get annoyed .. annoyed with people at all no matter what they did to me
S10-C03-R10_102446-102698	Outside university yes I sometimes do this [LAUGHTER]
S10-C03-R10_102836-104217	[HES] no actually sometimes maybe for example I am in a debate with somebody and .. any of my friends okay and I my feel that I want what I am going to say will be understood so I will say nonsense and I know that I am saying nonsense okay
S10-C03-R10_104217-104656	And I can tell him after that that I was saying nonsense actually
S10-C03-R10_105179-105366	No they believe [LAUGHTER]
S10-C03-R10_105940-106207	[HES] for a certain period of time or in general?
S10-C03-R10_106277-106795	It depends. If I don't have a mobile and the whole world is the same like me?
S10-C03-R10_107231-107633	Yes, yes, no, it's okay I am talking about the .. the phone calls actually
S10-C03-R10_107920-108510	No actually for me .. for me the phone calls are very important to me actually but I don't care about the other options
S10-C03-R10_110361-110651	What should I tell you and how should I start? [LAUGHTER]
S10-C03-R10_113662-113838	If you are pleased here, no you should stay here
S10-C03-R10_113926-115162	So I can .. actually I haven't been there honestly but I can go somewhere and I don't enjoy this and I feel that dealing with people is difficult for example or something, here I deal with people more easily so I can go back it's okay
S10-C03-R10_115220-115554	I don't think that I should do this honestly. [LAUGHTER]
S12-C03-R12_001483-002079	I am originally from Alexandria and I stayed there until I was four years old
S12-C03-R12_002079-004152	At first, I was in a Français pre-school but when we moved into Alexandria .. when we moved from Cairo. My mother doesn't know Français but papy does but he started a new job and so on and it was a start up and so on that he couldn't have time to follow up with me so I had to go to an English school
S12-C03-R12_004152-004883	I went to a national school and that's it
S12-C03-R12_006162-007966	When I joined university at the very beginning, once I joined university I chose major materials and .. but later on because it's somehow related to my father's work and so on but after I changed my mind
S12-C03-R12_007966-008502	I found this in .. in .. in .. in with many people and I saw their work related to mechatronics and so on
S12-C03-R12_008502-009956	A very close friend of mine was .. was in mechatronics and .. and he persuaded me to join this field and I liked what he said to me so that's why I went for it
S12-C03-R12_010663-010842	Okay [NOISE]
S12-C03-R12_010842-011568	[HES] My Bachelor project is actually somehow related to the optical field
S12-C03-R12_011568-011920	It's prepared in .. in the lab of optics
S12-C03-R12_011920-012761	And after that actually it's the introduction of the research .. actually the medical research
S12-C03-R12_012761-013764	We will use it later on after .. after that the results are supposed to be out so that it can be used in the medical research for .. for the sensors actually
S12-C03-R12_013764-015472	It .. it could be used later on as anyone can detect the weight of the weight of cells cancer cells for example, the weight any kind of bacteria that its mass is very small that it's difficult for anyone to detect it actually with the .. the ordinary balance
S12-C03-R12_016131-016880	Okay my daily routine is that I start by doing something that nobody does in Egypt actually
S12-C03-R12_016880-017755	For example, all people kept telling me that they drink nescafe or coffee and so on but for me I don't drink any of these, and not even tea or anything like that
S12-C03-R12_017755-018900	Actually when I wake up I can drink milk like kids or like when I was in the pre-school [LAUGHTER] .. and I still drink Mix Mix chocolate milk
S12-C03-R12_019221-021203	For example, if I get up too early because my brother's school is near to my university, sometimes I drive him to school after that I go to university and it's still vacant that I can park my car easily in the parking area as I park my car on the first row of the parking area which is really good because in the midday I can easily find my car at once
S12-C03-R12_021203-021790	That's it and now I go to the lab because this is my Bachelor
S12-C03-R12_021790-023358	And actually for example I run my experiments or something, if I don't do this, I can write the reports or something
S12-C03-R12_023358-025006	And after that we all started to feel hungry so we all leave the lab and go out to eat and have fun for some time then we come back and keep fighting to .. to choose who is going to continue working in the set up and so on
S12-C03-R12_025006-026321	That's it .. and we are supposed to leave the lab at four o'clock and this never happened [LAUGHTER] .. actually maybe if we finish our tasks early, we can leave early and this what we like the most actually
S12-C03-R12_026321-026997	And if we aren't done, I should stay working the whole day till the night comes actually once I stayed there till 9 pm
S12-C03-R12_026997-027893	So [HES] that's it and on the midday if we finish early, I go and pick my brother up and go home
S12-C03-R12_027893-029387	If I didn't finish early actually, I have intentions like anyone to lose weight and to go to the gym and to be super fit and so on, I was trying for a long time but I really love food very much
S12-C03-R12_030492-031799	Generally my hobbies do .. don't relate to my weekend plans or something no actually I can get up early in the morning and for example if I will not go anywhere, I can go to swim in the piscine of the club
S12-C03-R12_031799-032489	And it's okay if I am stressed or something, I can run on the track actually
S12-C03-R12_032489-033312	[HES] my hobbies are all about reading in general actually I love reading very much but it's not restricted to the weekend or something
S12-C03-R12_034524-035704	No the majority of my readings are in .. in Arabic, actually I really love history and in general this seems weird to anyone for example I chose major engineering or something but I love history very much since I was young actually
S12-C03-R12_035704-037598	[HES] I have no .. specific examples of my favorite books but I have two favorites one like Youssef Zidan as I almost read all his novels and I just brought his new novel from the book fair but I haven't started reading it yet
S12-C03-R12_037598-038233	[HES] I used to read The .. The Genius of Umar I used to read The Genius of Umar when I was young
S12-C03-R12_038233-039931	I really like his style of writing because it's not easily understood from the first time you read and you love to read, as you love to read it more than once even his .. his style of writing is .. unique ..
S12-C03-R12_039931-041327	In English %ma .. there was once something [HES] something that was also somehow related to history, called The Manuscript Found in Accra
S12-C03-R12_041327-041818	I read it as well and it was really good especially because it's written by Paulo Coelho
S12-C03-R12_041818-043862	Definitely I read The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho but I read it in Arabic because I had the same topic in the Arabic project in .. in the secondary stage as we were supposed to read the story and .. and analyze it and then summarize it, and that's it .. [HES] and .. that's it
S12-C03-R12_045289-045668	[HES] I mainly want to travel
S12-C03-R12_045668-045773	I want to travel to Germany
S12-C03-R12_045773-046325	Actually first of all I wanted to complete .. wanted to complete my Masters
S12-C03-R12_046325-047767	Actually I wish I won't be late actually once I finish university .. once I am done with the five years of university, I will complete my Masters at once but .. any plans after that .. yes the Masters that I am interested in should be related to cars
S12-C03-R12_047767-048643	[HES] but actually after that who don't wish to .. to work at Mercedes Benz or BMW or anything like that?
S12-C03-R12_048643-050458	But actually .. actually still .. definitely when I will start something related somehow to .. to this field and I find it mentioned in Masters, I will start to search for more aspects that I was not focusing on so at that time I can have something very specific that this .. this .. this is the dream job actually
S12-C03-R12_051346-051724	The first internship that I attended was after semester four
S12-C03-R12_051724-052749	[HES] I went to .. to the lab which was a chemical and analytical lab
S12-C03-R12_052749-053464	[HES] I wasn't related that much with my field but I am having a .. a study about it
S12-C03-R12_053464-054020	But I was .. actually I got it through one of my relatives
S12-C03-R12_054020-056141	At that time .. I was somehow broken down because .. I didn't do well in semester four at university so I wanted to feel that I am .. am good at something and that I succeed in it in order to .. to get over this
S12-C03-R12_056141-057376	So .. I started working there and I loved the experience as I went to work to interact with elder people even the idea that the field was different from what I studied that I learned a lot
S12-C03-R12_057376-058007	I discovered that I have good information about chemistry [LAUGHTER]
S12-C03-R12_058007-059534	And that was the first time I felt that I spent a month and half and I didn't want to leave actually I have plans actually that .. whenever I have time, I go to work and so on even if I will go once a week or something
S12-C03-R12_059534-060866	The second .. second internship I attended after semester six and I also got it through one of my relatives and it was in .. Emirates in Sharjah
S12-C03-R12_060866-063205	It was really my life experience because I stayed with my aunt in Dubai and I used to .. to work at the lab but it was petrol lab actually it was somehow related to my .. my field because there mechanical equipment and there were machines that they were making an assembly for it in order to .. to run on it the .. the .. the test
S12-C03-R12_063205-064875	So I used to get up at 6 am to go to work at 8:30 and I used to take three buses, a metro and .. and a taxi and I spent two hours on my way to work
S12-C03-R12_064875-065413	And definitely I wasn't .. wasn't familiar with the accent of the ..
S12-C03-R12_065918-067473	Yes I have traveled abroad . The first time I traveled was with my father when I was five years old . We went to Turkey .. because papy was having job tasks there so we went with him
S12-C03-R12_067473-068882	I had a situation there when my sister entered the toilette of the hotel and .. and she locked herself inside and she couldn't open the door
S12-C03-R12_068882-070329	We kept calling the reception so that they could send somebody to us and until they sent us somebody, they didn't understand English easily and finally they sent us someone to open the door and she kept crying and so on
S12-C03-R12_070329-071467	The second time is when I was in the third preparatory when we went to Turkey as well but that time I was almost a grown-up and I still remember the details there and I have many photos there
S12-C03-R12_071467-073961	The third time is when we went to Lebanon, Jordan and Emirates but what was really weird was that we stayed for less than forty eight hours in each country because our main goal was to go to Emirates and stay with my cousins and that's it .. as for Lebanon and Jordan, we went there because papy was having work there
S12-C03-R12_073961-074858	So once we arrived, he went to work and we had a tour all over Beirut in less than a day
S12-C03-R12_074858-075162	Then we went to Oman
S12-C03-R12_075413-075990	And .. and .. then to Dubai
S12-C03-R12_075990-076335	Then a year later we went to Dubai
S12-C03-R12_076335-076694	Then the next year we went to France
S12-C03-R12_076694-077034	And that was the first time for me to travel to Europe and so on
S12-C03-R12_077034-077999	And definitely, the best place was Disneyland actually I am a number one fan of Disney since I was young and I have already memorized their songs till now
S12-C03-R12_077999-078651	And .. and it was the first time to travel to a European country and so on
S12-C03-R12_078651-079437	And after that last year I went to Dubai again and that's it
S12-C03-R12_080805-081645	[HES] I went to Siwa, Siwa oasis once with my friends from the club and we were all of the same young age
S12-C03-R12_081645-082936	Definitely, it was a very new experiences the hotel there wasn't a hotel it was the resort itself as you felt as if you live in an old place
S12-C03-R12_082936-084322	And the country itself makes you feel that you used a time machine and that you went back even .. even we weren't familiar with people there .. we weren't familiar with the culture there and so on
S12-C03-R12_084322-086186	But she is nice and very small and there weren't any kind of technology there or anything like that there were no cars there and if you look at the sky at night, you can see a very clear sky full of stars and so on .. actually it was really nice honestly
S12-C03-R12_086186-086544	It was such an amazing landscape as you were staying in the desert listening to the deers' sounds and other weird sounds
S12-C03-R12_086544-087237	And .. and we swam in the .. the sulphur springs and it was really nice
S12-C03-R12_087237-088352	And Luxor and Aswan are nice too because I like monuments and things like that
S12-C03-R12_088352-088849	But the other places like Hurghada and Sharm ElSheikh are ordinary
S12-C03-R12_089897-091615	[HES] no, sure, I will love to travel abroad to build my future and in a way or another I am still young and if I didn't build my future now or didn't work hard now and .. actually I should .. make a plan for the future
S12-C03-R12_091615-092702	And my parents won't be pleased with me if I stayed with them doing nothing and .. this is what I really want long ago actually why not that I go for it
S12-C03-R12_092702-093297	[HES] actually I won't delay it actually because I am afraid
S12-C03-R12_093297-095505	Definitely, I know that it won't be easy to stay alone and .. and it will be a big responsibility that I become responsible for myself and you no longer .. have anybody to help you in any problem but I think that they won't forget me and they will come and visit me and I will visit them of course [LAUGHTER]
S12-C03-R12_099375-101284	[HES] that .. actually throughout my life I am such a disorganized person as I throw my stuff everywhere and my room was never neat and so on because I know that my mother will keep shouting at me for awhile then she will organize everything
S12-C03-R12_101284-103353	Once she got up in the morning and she was very very tired that we had too take her to hospital then he found out that she was suffering from blood pressure so I felt that I made her devote her health and that I took her health for granted actually I used to think that it's okay to leave everything messy because she will come and tidy the mess
S12-C03-R12_103353-104319	And I will pretend that I don't know but I realized that she was really tired and that we caused her problems
S12-C03-R12_104319-106544	I felt that no I .. cannot continue this .. this way and that I should start to .. actually improve myself and .. actually I can even help her because now we are facing a problem that she is not feeling well so no I should help her and especially that I am her eldest daughter
S12-C03-R12_107173-107436	Yes, my father sure [LAUGHTER]
S12-C03-R12_107436-108738	I know that this answer is somehow biased and many people may say so [COUGH] I really .. actually see him as a very smart and ambitious person
S12-C03-R12_108738-110490	And .. and .. and he is a self-made man that built himself on his own .. and he is open-minded as he lived abroad for a long time and .. and I like his way of thinking and the way he .. he deals with people
S12-C03-R12_110490-112005	And .. and actually even his mentality helps him think ninety percent right .. actually whenever he speaks about something, he has the evidence about it so it's already proved
S12-C03-R12_112005-112992	And .. and he can foreshadow the events based on .. on his experience or something else that I don't know
S12-C03-R12_112992-114534	And .. and he is a successful man in his work as he started his company from zero and now he is number one in his field and .. and his company is the best company to make the best turnover
S12-C03-R12_114534-115721	He is a successful manager and engineer and .. and in addition to this he .. he was the champion of Egypt in .. in and he was the Egyptian national team coach of handball
S12-C03-R12_115721-116074	He won the award of the best African player
S12-C03-R12_116074-117200	And .. and they won the African championship and he received a sport medal and .. and he received a sport medal from .. from Hosny Mubarak
S12-C03-R12_117349-117796	Actually .. he speaks three more languages other than Arabic
S12-C03-R12_117796-118364	And that's it to me, [LAUGHTER] he is a great man
S12-C03-R12_119020-119905	Respected of course especially if this field is work or something like that
S12-C03-R12_119905-120859	Yes what I will benefit from somebody that likes me then .. actually maybe .. that for example we, as Egyptians, have strong emotions somehow
S12-C03-R12_120859-122025	But people abroad are very practical and they don't have the concept of intimacy at work as they evaluate people according to their performance at work
S12-C03-R12_122025-123508	Maybe for example because I talk with people, for example I interact with people in a good way or something so that they respect me in return
S12-C03-R12_123508-124027	Actually I like to be respected and to be respected is not because I dress well or because .. actually maybe for example because I talk to people, for example I interact with people in a good way or something so people respect me back
S12-C03-R12_124812-125310	No no it's very easy that I can tell the story of my life to any passerby in the street actually [LAUGHTER]
S12-C03-R12_126109-127657	Actually if I deal .. deal with somebody that I know that his background for example .. his educational background is different from my educational background yes definitely I .. only I want to change my way so as .. not to annoy him
S12-C03-R12_127657-128905	Actually of course for example I deal with .. with somebody actually .. actually from a lower social standard okay so I want to change y way in order not to .. to let him the difference
S12-C03-R12_128905-130751	[HES] and no I have never .. actually .. actually .. definitely if somebody did something wrong to me okay, I can .. can respond according to what he did and I know that his way is like that that's why I am okay to deal with him in the same way
S12-C03-R12_132439-133444	[HES] actually the usage of English is that I kept using the conjunctions and .. yes okay
S12-C03-R12_133444-135263	[HES] actually it's .. actually it happens .. it actually like a project or something for example sometimes I am required to do something related to mechatronics for example someone is working in coding, someone is working in hardware and other one is working in electronics
S12-C03-R12_135263-137721	So yes somehow I may not perform some tasks .. that I don't understand exactly so yes actually I will beat around the bush and .. and yes actually I will try to make the conversation longer until the one in front of me gets bored and actually .. I may reach his point .. for example I may reach the limit that he wants me to explain
S12-C03-R12_138137-138989	No no absolutely actually sometimes I get up at night to check the .. the mobile actually I have .. the phobia of checking my mobile to make sure that nobody calls me then I will go back to sleep [LAUGHTER]
S12-C03-R12_138989-140271	[HES] it's not a good thing in general and it causes headache to me for example sometimes I don't do anything so I .. I forgot everything and I kept using it
S12-C03-R12_140271-141648	And this is .. actually not good and sometimes it causes me headaches and sometimes I go and ask my mother to take my mobile and not to give it back to me, if somebody is trying to call me, I don't want to answer I had a headache, I don't want to answer
S12-C03-R12_142308-143552	Okay I will persuade you that .. it's better to continue your education abroad outside Egypt
S12-C03-R12_143552-145484	[HES] actually maybe for example there are some parents refused to let their children study abroad .. and so on actually they should persuade their parents that they didn't spend all these years learning and at the end they are asked to put a limit to their ambitions.
S12-C03-R12_145484-146123	Actually I .. I should .. try and each person has to have his own life experience
S12-C03-R12_146123-146674	Actually for example when someone you know like your cousin for example gives you a negative feedback about life abroad saying that people there are not good
S12-C03-R12_146674-147109	No you should go and try this on your own to discover how life is not suitable for you
S12-C03-R12_147109-148603	You'll go there according to your background and your specific expectations so you will feel that .. that .. that actually you reach your goal and .. and that if it really meets your expectations that you thought of before coming or not
S12-C03-R12_148603-149405	So .. [HES] actually you cannot remain in your place because .. your parents wanted you to be there
S12-C03-R12_149405-151367	After that .. you'll discover that time flies and you did what they want and not what you want and .. and at that time you'll feel that your life is boring and you would blame yourself for not doing so? At that time you will be old enough that you have no time to regret what you did
S12-C03-R12_151367-152110	And your life will be based on routine and it will be constant and you kept thinking that you should have done something and you didn't and this won't change anything
S14-C03-R14_001362-002309	I was born in Cairo and when I was in the .. primary stage, I went to .. to a private school and we used to learn Arabic and English
S14-C03-R14_002790-003594	I couldn't .. couldn't afford to continue learning at a private school so I went to public schools in the preparatory and secondary stages
S14-C03-R14_003594-004036	But definitely I studied everything in Arabic in the preparatory and secondary stages
S14-C03-R14_005400-006583	Basically I joined computer science and my .. my major is all about information systems that we use to .. to analyze data, the retrieval and the storage and so on
S14-C03-R14_006583-006784	And why did I choose Computer Science?
S14-C03-R14_006784-007163	Basically because I liked using computers since I was young
S14-C03-R14_007163-008074	But at home they told me that I have two choices either I can be a computer scientist for example or to teach because I used to love teaching when I was young so I had to go for any of these choices
S14-C03-R14_009051-010031	My Bachelor project was like a mobile application that I created to simulate the behavior of the Google Pay and .. and Apple that is I Pay as well
S14-C03-R14_010031-011280	We wanted to create a universal application where you insert all your cards whether they are debit card, credit card or affiliation card that has to do with a specific organization or something and you used them instead of getting them out from your bag as you can just use them throughout the mobile
S14-C03-R14_011343-012307	Actually we wanted to have this idea as it's .. is already there but we wanted to collect everything and put it in one place only which is not Apple, actually Apple Pay support some options and don't support the other no e wanted to support everything
S14-C03-R14_013169-013760	Okay my daily routine is not different from the traditional daily routine that anyone has
S14-C03-R14_013760-014480	Basically I get up and check my schedule at work then I get dressed and go to work
S14-C03-R14_014480-014933	I don't get coffee like other people do and this is totally different from other people
S14-C03-R14_014933-015995	That's it, and afterwards i check the tutorials that i should finish or the correction or meetings or things of the sort or if there's something to work on in research, an experiment or so and that's it
S14-C03-R14_016546-017770	Yes basically my favorite hobby is to discover new music because I really love songs, so I sit by myself and open Anghami or something to listen to songs, if I like it, I get it, if not, I will check another one
S14-C03-R14_018069-018683	I will tell you basically when I was young, I used to listen to Arabic songs rather than English songs, when I grew up, I did the opposite as I listen to English songs rather than Arabic songs
S14-C03-R14_019223-019529	Yes I have a lot of favorite songs
S14-C03-R14_019529-020081	For example Michael Jackson is one of my favorite but he died, and now Ariana Grande is my favorite as well and that's it
S14-C03-R14_020081-020286	Any pop music singers but they should be good
S14-C03-R14_020974-021396	Yes it's been a long time since I last watched a movie
S14-C03-R14_021396-022066	I will tell you [HES] the last movie I watched at the cinema was The Glass
S14-C03-R14_022066-022254	That was the last movie I watched at the cinema basically
S14-C03-R14_022254-023440	It was about the idea of somebody who predicts that some people have supernatural potentials such as those who read the minds and those who did something else and he gathered them in a storyline
S14-C03-R14_023440-023948	And at the end he wanted them to take the same path and he wanted to put them in a team but he failed at the end
S14-C03-R14_025645-026517	If the idea of experimental schools is still there that they are public schools but at the same time they teach English and Arabic, but most of the subjects are in English, I would go for such schools
S14-C03-R14_026517-027450	If this system is canceled, because I know that they are against it and they want to cancel it, in this case, I have to enroll them in private schools and the .. the main language there is English and then the other language is Arabic
S14-C03-R14_028262-028872	Unfortunately, all the fields of science is taught in English, so if they don't know it, they won't be able to do research and won't be able to study, they can't produce anything
S14-C03-R14_029921-030211	My dream job was teaching since I was young
S14-C03-R14_030211-030332	I used to love to teach when I was young
S14-C03-R14_030332-030682	I used to bring all my relatives and let them sit in front of me and I kept explaining some topics to them
S14-C03-R14_030682-031403	If I weren't a teacher, basically I would .. would study space science
S14-C03-R14_031403-031881	But I didn't find it in Egypt, and when I found it, I found something called a Meteorological Organization and things like that
S14-C03-R14_031881-032134	So they told me that I will do researches on the weather so I told them that this is not my ambition
S14-C03-R14_032134-032338	I wanted to do more than this
S14-C03-R14_032338-032904	So this is my dream job, it's somehow related to space science
S14-C03-R14_032904-033835	But currently my dream job is to work in the software engineering that I should not only do the coding but I also collect the requirements and check the diagrams for example and to see the user stories and things like that
S14-C03-R14_035196-036197	Basically I didn't attend any internships but I would love to but I was not accepted in any place, I don't know why although they accepted applicants with lower GPAs than mine
S14-C03-R14_036197-036712	But the idea is that they don't target the GPA maybe they target another aspects
S14-C03-R14_036712-036980	I don't know what it is honestly
S14-C03-R14_036980-038310	Okay, now after working, do you prefer working life or university life when you were a student and you have no responsibilities at that time but also you have to study and so on?
S14-C03-R14_038310-038788	No definitely I would say university life because basically when I was at university there was a well structured program
S14-C03-R14_038788-039240	For example, say I was required that I will study one, two, three, four, you will get the grade, then you will succeed and that's it
S14-C03-R14_039240-039818	But now, I am doing the opposite, as I restructure the things then let people follow me and then succeed by the end
S14-C03-R14_039818-040288	Definitely doing something from scratch is more difficult than following a ready-made system.
S14-C03-R14_040460-041432	Okay can you tell us about the last place that you have visited in Egypt and what place influence you the most?
S14-C03-R14_041432-041874	Basically I am not the person you mean because I don't like traveling and I hate to make a lot of movements
S14-C03-R14_041874-042172	Actually I am that kind of person who loves to settle in a place, I don't like to move a lot.
S14-C03-R14_042172-042741	But basically it's been a very long time since I last traveled, it's been five years since I last traveled abroad.
S14-C03-R14_042741-043510	I was in the States so .. so what? Yes what I have seen there was different from what's here in Egypt
S14-C03-R14_043510-044603	But what influenced me there is the downtown there as it looked very nice, and there was .. was .. was something like an arena where they watch their matches of WWA that is wrestling and so on and I love this
S14-C03-R14_044603-044728	So I hoped to attend such events
S14-C03-R14_044728-044993	But I saw it from outside it was wow and the arena was huge
S14-C03-R14_045936-047732	I will say basically actually, the question is actually [LAUGHTER] I will say, basically I have no problem with Egypt as a country. My problem is with .. with the mentality as not all .. all people are the same or most of the people that live outside Egypt, the problem is in their mentality
S14-C03-R14_047732-048082	Actually they misunderstand the people surround them
S14-C03-R14_048352-049298	Or that we have for example a high level of authority, so you should follow us and if they didn't do this, we will get into debates or things like that
S14-C03-R14_049884-050320	Actually if .. if we removed those bad people and replaced them with better people, I would be happy
S14-C03-R14_054625-056313	I will tell you, basically yes and I am in a state of mind like that, for example, I stayed for two .. or three years at university and I search example and I .. I study for example and I give tutorials and that's it so this is the point and so what? what's next? would I continue this or not? for example I can go for a scholarship as Dalia told me or not?
S14-C03-R14_056313-056672	I am in a state of mind and something like that and I don't know where I am? Or what am I going to do?
S14-C03-R14_056672-056965	So actually I'm in a middle of a turning point
S14-C03-R14_056965-057623	Okay do you feel that this turning point is changing your personality? Or your personality doesn't change but you change your way of thinking so what will you do now?
S14-C03-R14_057710-058896	It changes my way of thinking of course but it won't change my personality, because this is not that turning point that will change my personality a lot no but it changes my state for example it can take me to a better or a worse place, it depends on my thought
S14-C03-R14_058896-059903	Okay, good when you were a student or a TA, do you prefer working in a team or .. or working individually to handle the project and everything on your own?
S14-C03-R14_059903-060382	I will tell you, when I was a student, I used to work individually, and .. but I have trust issues
S14-C03-R14_060382-060543	Actually I don't trust anyone easily
S14-C03-R14_060543-061014	For example, I know that his performance at work is not got or that he will cause problems, so I won't work with him
S14-C03-R14_061014-061957	So most of the times yes I was making teams for the sake of making a team but at the end I was doing everything individually and we pass the evaluation because I explain to everyone what they should do
S14-C03-R14_061957-062957	At university as a TA, if I work in the course individually, I definitely prefer working in the course individually because of the organization so .. so it will be only one, so as not to have any miscommunication or something
S14-C03-R14_062957-063376	And if I will work with another TA, it depends on the trust, my level
S14-C03-R14_063417-063914	So yes for example I worked with people that I trust them greatly and I worked with other people that caused problems
S14-C03-R14_064968-065387	Yes there is, but we said that we will not mention name so of course there's
S14-C03-R14_066082-066252	No they are professors here at university
S14-C03-R14_066652-067074	No, a lot of things. Actually, there's a specific example as I like everything he does
S14-C03-R14_067516-067809	No actually the presentation skills that he has
S14-C03-R14_067809-068029	The way that he knows how to deliver the correct info to people
S14-C03-R14_068070-068452	His way of thinking or his logical thinking? Do I get it?
S14-C03-R14_069283-069986	Liked or respected? Okay .. if people like, they will definitely respect you at some point .. some point
S14-C03-R14_071349-071806	I prefer to be liked rather than respected because at the end, if you like me, you can respect me somehow
S14-C03-R14_071851-072741	Okay, do you feel that you are an easy person to talk with at the beginning? Or they take time to break the ice?
S14-C03-R14_072773-073464	On the contrary, I am the one who takes time to adapt with people, as anybody can adapt with me but I cannot adapt with anyone at once
S14-C03-R14_073464-074808	Okay do you find it difficult to deal with people from a different social level whether it's higher or lower? Do you need to change your way of speaking, your attitude in general when you deal with social levels and so on?
S14-C03-R14_074808-074981	I will tell what's supposed to happen
S14-C03-R14_074981-075461	You're supposed to change your spee .. your speech based on which level you are talking with whether it's higher or lower than yours
S14-C03-R14_075461-075646	But I don't know how to this
S14-C03-R14_075646-075842	And that may cause some problems
S14-C03-R14_075842-076114	So I like to avoid dealing with someone who is higher or lower than me
S14-C03-R14_076114-076711	But if I had to do so, I will respect those who are lower, but sometimes this backfire me
S14-C03-R14_076711-076926	Sometimes he thinks that I underestimate him or something
S14-C03-R14_076926-077496	On the contrary, when I call him Sir or something, he considered that I am showing arrogance but I don't mean this at all
S14-C03-R14_078536-078886	I will tell you, the best trait I have is that I like being helpful
S14-C03-R14_078886-079240	Actually I wish not to change this trait whatsoever actually
S14-C03-R14_080543-080644	If he is a liar
S14-C03-R14_080644-080858	I cannot deal with him at all
S14-C03-R14_082779-083600	[HES] I have never done this actually, but as for the evaluation I like when I talk about something, I should understand what I am talking about
S14-C03-R14_083600-084048	If I don't understand this .. I will tell you that I don't understand or I can ask about what you mean
S14-C03-R14_085055-085403	Honestly I was not saying nonsense, but I have never been in this situation
S14-C03-R14_085403-085819	I have never .. I always like to be ready and efficient enough
S14-C03-R14_086164-086369	I don't like to be a situation like that
S14-C03-R14_086741-088030	[HES] if .. if you .. if you will remove the applications yes maybe, but if I .. I will use it to talk to people, maybe I need somebody for example, so actually no. [LAUGHTER]
S14-C03-R14_088097-089394	Okay as for the last question, can you choose anything you want and persuade us of for example .. you can persuade us to complete Master's, to travel abroad, or not to travel abroad, or anything .. anything that you are persuaded of to let us be persuaded
S16-C03-R16_001407-001686	Yes sure, first of all I was born in Alexandria
S16-C03-R16_001686-002731	I went to a national school until I became in .. in middle three, so I went to an IG or pre-IG, but after that I continued four years in an IG school
S16-C03-R16_002731-003727	After finishing the IG, I used to focus mainly on fields like mathematics, physics or ICT because at the that time I thought of joining computer science or anything related to IT field
S16-C03-R16_003727-005081	[HES] after finishing school, I went to Cairo, joined the university of Cairo and I did majoring in computer science as I wished to do this, but it was definitely computer engineering because there's not computer science in that university
S16-C03-R16_005081-005942	And now I graduated and became an engineer, it's mentioned in my ID that I am a free electrical engineer and I'm teaching as a teaching assistant hardware courses
S16-C03-R16_006580-007009	[HES] It was mainly English and Arabic, but there was French at the beginning
S16-C03-R16_007734-008369	Yes my Bachelor was titled gamifying physiotherapy and android wearable game for adolescent patients, a very long title
S16-C03-R16_008369-008735	Basically it was about serious games with HCI
S16-C03-R16_008735-010151	There were kids, or in general there were kids having problems with their muscles, they can't move their hands or their wrest and so on, so we was trying to teach them their physiotherapy exercises in a fun and interactive way, gamified
S16-C03-R16_010151-010788	There was a smart wearable that detects the movements of the child
S16-C03-R16_010788-012163	And there's mainly a game that was mine, it was called music chasers and it's all about a song and song was being played as long as he made the once right movements, if he made a wrong movement, the song would be paused and he should continue doing the right movement so as not to stop the song
S16-C03-R16_012163-012589	So mainly it's that he exercises or do his physiotherapy exercises
S16-C03-R16_012589-013783	And instead of going to a certain institute to get treatment or something and even in the countryside where they don't have hospitals or take a long time to go to a hospital, so no using android device and smart wearables enables him to do exercises at home
S16-C03-R16_014439-015035	So mainly this semester is because .. I have a lot of tasks in the first slot so I get up early
S16-C03-R16_015035-015262	Actually I get up at 7 am or 7:30 am
S16-C03-R16_015262-016039	I already live near to university actually, in the same area, so I don't have to get up too early and actually I have my own car, so I have no problem
S16-C03-R16_016039-017135	I get up, have breakfast, go to university and check if I have teaching, I have correction like midterms, finals or quizzes, I have content preparation for the coming weeks
S16-C03-R16_017135-018085	After going home, I call my friends to hang out to watch the matches like champion league for example or we can play soccer and son then I sleep and that's it
S16-C03-R16_018729-019388	Mainly in the weekends, I like to meet my friends on Friday in the morning until it's 4 o'clock for example
S16-C03-R16_019388-019988	We usually have the tradition of playing soccer on Saturday at night at one of the schools, in that area
S16-C03-R16_019988-021550	So actually maybe because I don't have long weekend in this semester because I have teaching first on Saturday, so I have to prepare the content on Friday because I have teaching on Wednesday fifth actually so my weekend in this semester is Thursday and Friday
S16-C03-R16_021550-022112	Actually I have a break on Thursday and on Friday I prepare, I have first teaching actually
S16-C03-R16_022315-022557	[HES] somehow
S16-C03-R16_023277-023731	I'm pretty sure it's English because I already hate the Arabic literature
S16-C03-R16_023731-024474	I don't remember exactly the last book but everything was almost academic, it's related to Master's anyways
S16-C03-R16_025027-025258	The last movie I watched at the cinema was Captain Marvel
S16-C03-R16_025258-025931	I was very anticipating to see what's going to happen in Avengers End Game and the build up of Avengers End Game, so I went to watch it at the cinema
S16-C03-R16_025931-026281	Yes actually expectations versus reality, the movie wasn't that
S16-C03-R16_026281-026770	But now actually he completed the missing part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe
S16-C03-R16_028366-028892	Maybe because I was in the IG in an international, I definitely support the international education system
S16-C03-R16_029350-029531	Although the governments are making improvements
S16-C03-R16_029531-030313	But also I believe that they are my children as they are supposed to receive the best education provided by international institutes and international curriculum
S16-C03-R16_031400-031823	I will tell you, basically, the first thing for example how I became a TA?
S16-C03-R16_031823-032376	I wanted to complete the Master's and also at the same time I want to work in the industry
S16-C03-R16_032376-033052	So actually my dream goal or my dream job is to travel abroad, and to go to one of the tag giants in USA
S16-C03-R16_033052-033443	I used to travel there, and at the same time, I wanted to work in the research and development
S16-C03-R16_033443-034216	The R and D the parts that develop and their things, they do research behind the applications and the software and the hardware and so on
S16-C03-R16_034216-035357	But actually I'm dreaming of pursuing a Master's in Egypt and a PhD abroad, I don't work in the academic field as in teaching would be my main focus or my main role, but to work in industry as research and development
S16-C03-R16_036435-036877	As internships or as a student, I used to work in two companies in three months
S16-C03-R16_036877-037100	I worked for a month in the first company and I worked for two months in the second company
S16-C03-R16_037100-037705	Both companies have nothing to do with development, they were just IT, technical support or maintenance
S16-C03-R16_037705-038346	It was a good experience as I didn't study this at university, but actually we have work and people are interested in this
S16-C03-R16_038346-038778	After that, after I had finished the internships, I became a TA
S16-C03-R16_038778-040343	Actually people are surprised especially my friends as I didn't really like hardware courses and actually I'm not into hardware, yet the two courses that I teach are hardware courses because for me hardware is actually easy teaching-wise .. or I find it easy I mean
S16-C03-R16_040343-041839	Maybe it's not the best thing or the most enjoyable thing, but after I taught the hardware courses no I felt that they are good but I'm interested in them, although my Master's are not hardware, and actually I will not ever focus on mastering or PhD in hardware
S16-C03-R16_041839-042392	Because definitely it's full of a lot of technical details and I was not the cleverest one in physics and so on
S16-C03-R16_042392-042862	But no actually I am glad and I have no problem
S16-C03-R16_043962-044569	All my colleagues in the office and all the TAs said that they wished to be students again studying and so on is better that working as TAs
S16-C03-R16_044569-045789	I am the only one who says no, working as TAs is the best, it's not the best career as a TA but the best thing is that I don't study, I wouldn't have final exam and I should study for it, I don't have projects, no maybe it's .. a little bit flexible
S16-C03-R16_045789-046447	But as for me I study a certain course to teach it, but no I see that working life is better than being a student
S16-C03-R16_046761-046968	[HES] no I have never traveled abroad
S16-C03-R16_047542-048008	[HES] inside Egypt? A place that I like?
S16-C03-R16_048008-049308	Actually technically I am not .. not .. not into Egypt that much, but at that time when I was living in Alexandria, what I really liked was when I went to Cairo and saw the Egyptian museum and the Pharaonic monuments and so on
S16-C03-R16_049308-050374	To me Alexandria as a coastal city, as we used to sit by the beach and even the North Coast and so on, things like that, and even the monuments there were more into Roman, like Romanian and Greek monuments
S16-C03-R16_050374-051216	When I saw the origin of the Pharaonic civilization such as the pyramids, the Sphinx and so on, no actually I felt that Egypt has a great heritage
S16-C03-R16_051216-051359	It was somehow interesting
S16-C03-R16_052342-053586	As I told in the beginning, my dream is to travel to Europe or the US, I pursue my PhD degree, and after that I will work there and settle in one of the tech giants, so definitely I'll accept it
S16-C03-R16_054899-055437	Mainly, when I participated in student activities at university especially my last two years
S16-C03-R16_055437-055633	No my way of thinking started to change
S16-C03-R16_055633-056834	The community was different as they started to shape actually the new friends that I made or the new friendship that I used to make that I started to .. to shape and it influenced me especially when I see my friends for example say what they want to do when they grow up
S16-C03-R16_056834-057291	No I felt that I can change my vision of life
S16-C03-R16_057291-057837	But no actually I was determined when I was at school to join computer science and I joined computer science
S16-C03-R16_057837-058599	Maybe in the last few years I dreamed to be a TA but not because TA is good, but because I want complete Master's and I want to make PhD and to continue this track
S16-C03-R16_058599-059492	No I find what I wanted in my life so it's achieved. No I feel that actually that such ambitions that I have already wished are being achieved
S16-C03-R16_060410-060641	It depends on the projects
S16-C03-R16_060641-061053	Actually for example the game for instance, I told my partner that I will do it all on my own
S16-C03-R16_061053-061134	It was very interesting
S16-C03-R16_061134-061406	It was Yugi-Oh and I used to love Yugi from the childhood memories
S16-C03-R16_061406-061706	I told him that I don't need his help and that I will work on the whole project on my own
S16-C03-R16_061706-061902	Thank God I got A plus at the end and we finalized everything
S16-C03-R16_061902-062068	No it .. it was a good project honestly
S16-C03-R16_062068-062480	So that was a type of project I like to work on individually
S16-C03-R16_062480-063145	There are some other projects that we should divide the tasks as each one will be responsible for his tasks and so on because they are projects mega projects big projects
S16-C03-R16_063145-063341	They require multiple people to work on
S16-C03-R16_064583-064721	It's a difficult question honestly
S16-C03-R16_064721-065452	Basically when a person feels down, does he actually say it's okay I don't care about the grade whether it's five percent, ten percent, percent fifteen percent for project the project?
S16-C03-R16_065452-065849	So actually it's okay what's important is what grade we will get
S16-C03-R16_065849-067246	But no by the end actually [HES] as motivation-wise, we kept working on the project for example before it we could go and watched a match for example, actually there motivational boosters to get us more motivated
S16-C03-R16_067246-067716	We can have a break for some time without working on the project, we go to the cinema, actually
S16-C03-R16_068254-068814	No I don't have for example .. I don't have a role model in all fields, I have only one
S16-C03-R16_068814-069510	But no I have a role model in a specific field that I want to achieve a goal that he has already achieved
S16-C03-R16_069510-070026	For example for example when it comes to technology, Steve Jobs is my role model for example
S16-C03-R16_070026-070580	When it comes to soccer actually I prefer for example somebody like Abu Trika or Mohamed Salah as role models
S16-C03-R16_070580-070846	But I don't have the specific role model in general
S16-C03-R16_071440-071705	Liked or respected?
S16-C03-R16_071705-072014	I guess respected
S16-C03-R16_072014-072118	Why?
S16-C03-R16_072118-072699	Because actually if people respect you, eventually they .. will like you
S16-C03-R16_072699-073356	But maybe at the beginning they fear so they respect you for example or maybe they are fear or something
S16-C03-R16_073356-074510	But after that, once they get to know you better, especially that you treat him with respect and so on, so maybe eventually you may like each other or there might be likelihood or whatever
S16-C03-R16_075881-076525	No it's okay I have no problem at all, actually I love to get to know people actually, I am very sociable in this part
S16-C03-R16_076525-076899	No actually for example they can get to know me in a very short time actually
S16-C03-R16_076899-077123	I don't .. don't take time to get to know people
S16-C03-R16_078257-078502	Social level as in what actually?
S16-C03-R16_079027-080537	As an education-wise actually definitely for example in general if I speak with code-switching, I .. I .. I switch from Arabic into English for example a lot of my speech, no for example I choose for example if I am in a taxi or any transportation, of course I won't speak with him in English in .. such context
S16-C03-R16_080537-081030	So I had to speak using .. terminologies that he understands
S16-C03-R16_082041-082531	I am dreamy and I like to imagine how my future will look like
S16-C03-R16_083657-084153	If he doesn't respect other people or he keeps bullying them
S16-C03-R16_084241-084338	And things like that
S16-C03-R16_085643-085902	I have a deadline for example and I haven't even started yet
S16-C03-R16_085937-086210	This .. this is mainly stress
S16-C03-R16_086210-087164	But they aren't deadlines projects and so on, no they are deadlines in my life in general, for example for example such as submitting your military status documents, urgent things that are really important to your future and you can lose everything if you don't do it
S16-C03-R16_087164-088232	Maybe I became stressed over a presentation for example work or interview or work, and so on as my career, my life depends on passing this interview or this presentation, so no I am stressed
S16-C03-R16_088232-088600	But if I am well-prepared, it's okay stress will go away
S16-C03-R16_091041-091318	I kept asking you about the functions of the anode and cathode
S16-C03-R16_091318-091791	[HES] it could be .. no I did do this in the Bachelor presentation
S16-C03-R16_091791-092676	[HES] the seminar no maybe even the seminar presentation also as its topics included terminologies that we didn't understand such terminologies
S16-C03-R16_092676-092992	Because in the seminar, he gave you papers to read and to present those papers
S16-C03-R16_092992-093453	So you don't understand it, you just say as it is with its terminology and that's it actually
S16-C03-R16_093453-093979	But no, but actually most probably no I didn't use sophisticated .. words before because I didn't understand
S16-C03-R16_094064-094253	I never had something like that
S16-C03-R16_094583-094668	No
S16-C03-R16_095003-095742	Because basically the mobile is now connected to everything either it has social network, your friends, chats, and so on
S16-C03-R16_095742-096737	Of course some people are trying to get away from the mobile and so on, but no I feel that my life is related to it as I should check for example my newsfeed, I check for example Instagram, check Twitter, check the news
S16-C03-R16_096737-097213	Even for example I want to call somebody for example even phone call it's necessarily to be texting
S16-C03-R16_097213-097737	No the mobile should be essential for each individual in the world
S16-C03-R16_098491-098695	You remind me of Black Mirror
S16-C03-R16_098695-099219	So technically the episodes of Black Mirror tackle how can technology go wrong
S16-C03-R16_099219-100145	So okay yes communication-wise the situation was much better before, people sit face to face and they communicate, now people can just send texts and even short messages
S16-C03-R16_100145-101107	But eventually now you can talk to somebody in another country, somebody in another continent, it becomes much easier to talk with him instead of traveling, so this makes him closer
S16-C03-R16_101107-101965	But definitely actually it's like a weapon with two edges, actually it could be bad, or it could be good, but I see that its advantages are more than its disadvantages
S16-C03-R16_103016-103335	No it's .. it's difficult to persuade you to ..
S16-C03-R16_103335-103462	Should I persuade you to do something?
S16-C03-R16_103920-103974	Okay
S16-C03-R16_104109-104728	Definitely actually last year there were so many people asking us what's the importance of embedded systems course in our life?
S16-C03-R16_104728-105351	And we as DMET especially MET why do we study hardware in such level, and that we implement wiring parts?
S16-C03-R16_105351-105782	And people already hate the wiring from project circuit two to project DSD
S16-C03-R16_105782-105917	And why do we deal with hardware?
S16-C03-R16_105917-106343	I like to tell you people that those who are in mechatronics wish to take this embedded course
S16-C03-R16_106936-107174	That you take course that mechatronics department don't take
S16-C03-R16_107697-108067	While mechatronics have to take a diploma to be able to pass the test
S16-C03-R16_108067-108729	And you have like fifty, sixty, seventy percent of the content of the test, there's only one small part missing
S16-C03-R16_108729-109114	So actually you could be hardware engineers and to make money and be rich
S17-C03-R17_001769-002127	[HES] I was born in Cairo
S17-C03-R17_002127-002673	I lived here in Egypt until I was in grade six I went to .. school
S17-C03-R17_002773-002943	I went to a school in ElTayran street
S17-C03-R17_002943-003172	I live in Nasr city, Abbas Elaakad
S17-C03-R17_003172-003395	I were there until I was in grade six
S17-C03-R17_003395-003711	After grade 6 I traveled to Emirates
S17-C03-R17_003711-004114	I used to stay in .. in El Ain
S17-C03-R17_004114-004550	I went to an American school
S17-C03-R17_004646-004991	I graduated in two thousand and fifteen
S17-C03-R17_004991-005622	Then I joined this university engineering mechatronics
S17-C03-R17_005860-006292	[HES] why did I choose mechatronics?
S17-C03-R17_006292-006845	Because I love working in the field of industry
S17-C03-R17_006957-007342	And at the same time I hate theoretical materials
S17-C03-R17_007342-007560	I always like practical work
S17-C03-R17_007560-007913	And I will persuade you by the end
S17-C03-R17_007972-008060	Okay
S17-C03-R17_008217-008304	But
S17-C03-R17_010519-010826	As I told you I love practical work
S17-C03-R17_010826-011465	At the beginning we used to study the materials of physics, math, and chemistry that we used to study in the general secondary
S17-C03-R17_011465-011838	But they weren't the best for me
S17-C03-R17_011838-012636	I didn't start to like the .. the major itself as mechatronics except in semester five maybe
S17-C03-R17_012636-013153	Because I started to find what I was studying in physics and math and I started to see it
S17-C03-R17_013342-013736	I started to see it, I mean that I started to apply what I studied
S17-C03-R17_014457-015812	My Bachelor project mainly focused on the field that we didn't study at university especially it's optics
S17-C03-R17_015812-016890	And the optics in the .. the coming, actually the sensors that we are using now are no longer the best
S17-C03-R17_016890-017781	So my project is about the sensors that monitor cancer cells
S17-C03-R17_018934-019344	I get up at 6 am
S17-C03-R17_019531-020052	Exactly an hour and I take the bus at 7 o'clock, the bus arrives university at eight to fifteen o'clock
S17-C03-R17_020231-020970	The day starts from 8 o'clock until 6 o'clock by maximum
S17-C03-R17_024953-025126	No, I don't like reading at all.
S17-C03-R17_026381-026537	The movie Life of Pi
S17-C03-R17_026537-026847	This movie is about an Indian boy
S17-C03-R17_026847-028157	This Indian boy [HES] he had a zoo in India, and decided to immigrate taking with him all the animals
S17-C03-R17_028157-028600	He immigrated by the ship, that's it
S17-C03-R17_028746-029019	And when they were on the ship, the ship sank
S17-C03-R17_029019-029626	Nothing remained on the ship except the boy Pi and the tiger
S17-C03-R17_029626-030690	He didn't discover that that the tiger is alive until he took a boat trying to survive then he found the tiger came from the ship
S17-C03-R17_030690-031862	That's it, he was in water all that time, he was trying to survive, how to eat, how to drink, how he .., he sailed by boat until he reached the shore
S17-C03-R17_031980-032074	That's it
S17-C03-R17_033513-034089	There's no .. no specific singer that I love to listen to, on the contrary I listen to everything
S17-C03-R17_034089-034758	I don't always care about the lyrics as much as I care about the rhythm and the music itself
S17-C03-R17_036050-036722	Before I start thinking of mechatronics, I hoped to join aeronautical engineering
S17-C03-R17_036722-037185	But our problem is that aeronautical engineering is found in Cairo university only
S17-C03-R17_037185-037519	And this is very difficult to me
S17-C03-R17_037519-037823	But the second option for me is mechatronics
S17-C03-R17_037823-038507	So as for my dream job, I wanted to join mechatronics in the aeronautical engineering
S17-C03-R17_038737-039658	Okay well, can you tell us about the internships that you attended or the full-time or part-time jobs that you had when you were at university?
S17-C03-R17_039805-040500	I have never had any jobs whether they are part-time or full-time
S17-C03-R17_040573-041067	But I attended only one internship in summer in a car factory
S17-C03-R17_041365-041430	That's it
S17-C03-R17_041430-041592	It was for a month
S17-C03-R17_041792-042264	We used to watch the assembly line of cars, the stages of collecting the automotive parts, the stages of painting
S17-C03-R17_044442-044639	I don't like anything theoretical
S17-C03-R17_044639-045389	I haven't started to enjoy the .. the major until I started working on the Bachelor
S17-C03-R17_045389-045995	And actually I learned topics hundred times more than what I learned in the seven semesters
S17-C03-R17_047200-047767	I used to live in Emirates so .. regardless of Emirates, I have never been to anywhere else
S17-C03-R17_048640-048741	Sharm ElSheikh
S17-C03-R17_048942-049930	I liked the landscapes there, staying .. at the hotel without any responsibilities, without anything else, it's only relaxation
S17-C03-R17_051422-052301	Definitely for me, if I found that it won't make any difference and that it's like staying here, no definitely I will stay in my homeland
S17-C03-R17_053907-054439	If this difference is significant, yes I have no problem to make this decision to live abroad
S17-C03-R17_054439-055254	On the contrary, I will deal with a new culture, new people, a totally new different life, so I like this
S17-C03-R17_056809-057873	[HES] at first as I told you, in the first semesters at university, it was totally theoretical for me, as we used to solve mathematics equations, I didn't want this
S17-C03-R17_057873-058547	But at the same time there weren't anything else or the other major will not be related to this at first
S17-C03-R17_058547-059054	So to me the best choice is to continue and wait
S17-C03-R17_061014-062758	Actually for me, I made a car accident, before this, I was very reckless, but after that, I started to .. to take everything into account before doing it, and that's it
S17-C03-R17_063888-064670	The .. the group work has its advantage and the single work has another advantage
S17-C03-R17_064670-065649	In the group work, you collect ideas from many people. So as a result the probability to get the best result is big
S17-C03-R17_065649-066461	But when I work alone, I will be secured about the .. the quality that is a result of my work
S17-C03-R17_066461-066860	The implementation of the idea itself differs
S17-C03-R17_066860-067779	Like we can summarize this in the idiom that says, too .. too many cooks spoil the broth
S17-C03-R17_068973-069082	My father
S17-C03-R17_069239-069846	[HES] to me he has a very big responsibility
S17-C03-R17_069846-070406	I didn't find this in any other father, anyways
S17-C03-R17_070406-071058	But to me he is the perfect model actually I do like him
S17-C03-R17_071058-071877	I don't mean that I do the same as he did, no the way he deals with people, his attitude, his mentality
S17-C03-R17_071877-072251	I like to imitate him
S17-C03-R17_074371-075365	Being liked is that I change myself to be .. be liked, and the same happens with the other person
S17-C03-R17_075365-075661	I will keep changing because I won't be liked by everyone at once
S17-C03-R17_075661-076138	In order to be liked by someone .. I will change for this reason, then I will change for the sake of the other person
S17-C03-R17_076138-076739	But to be respected, I .. I will be the only one, that's it
S17-C03-R17_076739-077818	So whoever likes me .. should like me as I am, and this is .. is respect and he will deal with me based on this respect, I won't need to change myself for him
S17-C03-R17_080166-080517	I hate to deal with that kind of person who thinks that he is the smartest man in the world
S17-C03-R17_080517-080721	There's not a smartest one in the world
S17-C03-R17_080826-081795	On the contrary I will to deal with the one who accept the other, it could be a good idea but at the same time, it could be bad
S17-C03-R17_081795-082000	Personally, I can find both good and bad ideas
S17-C03-R17_082000-083077	But I hate the one who thinks that he's the smartest person in the world, because he is very arrogant, in a higher level he started saying wrong ideas just because he believes that he is the best
S17-C03-R17_084800-084928	Reckless
S17-C03-R17_085066-085865	I was always reckless in the decisions I made, and sometimes in my reactions
S17-C03-R17_085865-086921	But now I am trying to stop being reckless, and to stop my spontaneous reactions
S17-C03-R17_086921-087362	I kept thinking before doing anything or taking any action towards anything
S17-C03-R17_088796-089400	[HES] naturally I have a different taste
S17-C03-R17_089511-089707	And mostly moody
S17-C03-R17_089707-090804	And I don't .. don't give the chance to anyone who deals with me because I know that he won't like this
S17-C03-R17_090804-091442	Unless I stayed with him for a period of time, we are trying to discover one another
S17-C03-R17_091442-092434	We understood each other we are on the same track we started .. started to get to know him more and I started to deal with him more, and as a result he can get closer to me actually, that's it
S17-C03-R17_093495-094211	No not at all, on the contrary the community that surrounds me, I feel that we are all the same level
S17-C03-R17_094211-094442	I have to problem to deal with them
S17-C03-R17_094442-094596	This has to do with university
S17-C03-R17_094596-094863	Outside university, of course you interact with other people
S17-C03-R17_094863-095960	I can deal with workers, engineers, doctors, the way I deal with each person differs. So I should .. see who I deal with, and I start to deal with him in the same way
S17-C03-R17_097872-098376	If I study and memorize, memorize memorize for the exam okay what should I do after the exam? Nothing
S17-C03-R17_098376-099743	When I finish the exam and realize that I forgot something, like when I wanted to remember something that I have studied in the previous semester, I couldn't remember it at some time, so I started to feel that I'm stressed
S17-C03-R17_099743-099869	So what it is
S17-C03-R17_099869-100304	Where I can find the information, or the part .. part that I know, where I can found it
S17-C03-R17_100304-100719	Okay later on, who will tell me this or will teach us this
S17-C03-R17_100881-102687	Okay .. actually did it happen before when you were in an evaluation at university or any other situation when you were asked a topic that you didn't understand, so you had to speak in English or mention very difficult expressions in order to .. skip the meeting and that's all, and the one in front of you says that you really understand, so the situation would pass
S17-C03-R17_102762-104296	No, on the contrary I am very cautious in such situations even .. even if I am vague in my speech, that the one in front of me can understand clearly what I say because if he doesn't understand, I will make it more clear for him; otherwise it will be misunderstood
S17-C03-R17_104296-104593	Okay if it's wrong, what will happen next?
S17-C03-R17_104593-105029	No I hate being in such level, I prefer being clear and honest in everything
S17-C03-R17_105029-105731	Or I I want to reach a certain point, I reach this point and keep repeating it until it becomes clear
S17-C03-R17_105869-106257	Can we live without a mobile and why?
S17-C03-R17_106492-107146	I like isolation, so maybe, actually I can live without a mobile for a certain period of time
S17-C03-R17_107146-108098	But when I reach at some point that I want to call somebody, I want to express something, so no I will need it
S17-C03-R17_109115-109432	Anything I want
S17-C03-R17_109571-109657	Pause
S17-C03-R17_109657-109932	You'll see how this will take us, let's go
S17-C03-R17_110050-110685	[HES] I can persuade you that mechatronics are more important than MET
S17-C03-R17_110685-111209	Because in MET, they code
S17-C03-R17_111209-111555	Or according to what I understand they code that's it
S17-C03-R17_111555-112184	As for mechatronics, we code, connect electricity, connect mechanisms
S17-C03-R17_112184-113004	So if we said that .. that MET can the same tasks of mechatronics, no. But mechatronics can do the tasks of MET
S17-C03-R17_113004-113199	So as a result mechatronics is more important
S17-C03-R17_113273-114610	Okay, okay, what you have said is relatively right but .. I won't say that mechatronics is not important, mechatronics are very important, because they have their work but at some point when you code, you'll reach a point where you cannot continue
S17-C03-R17_118739-119647	As for mechatronics, it doesn't need the complexity of coding that they use at work or in computer science or MET in general
S17-C03-R17_119647-120569	As for mechatronics, the .. the part of code is what they use, it's the mostly used part, he know it very well
S17-C03-R17_120569-120731	I don't need more
S17-C03-R17_120731-121226	On the contrary, besides he knows electricity, knows mechanics
S17-C03-R17_121226-121679	As for MET, he can sit in front of a robot, and just write the code
S17-C03-R17_121679-121941	Okay how this code reacts, how it works
S17-C03-R17_121941-122055	Okay why it didn't work?
S17-C03-R17_122055-122373	How electricity is connected to it, and so on, he cannot do this
S17-C03-R17_123102-123322	Exactly, sure
S17-C03-R17_123356-123629	But this doesn't mean that this is more important than the other
S23-C03-R23_001248-001672	[HES] okay should I tell you my age?
S23-C03-R23_001672-001760	No it's not necessary
S23-C03-R23_001798-002423	I went to [HES] national Français school then I joined an international [HES] university
S23-C03-R23_002423-002681	I joined mass communication
S23-C03-R23_002681-002965	That's why when I graduated from university I came back here again
S23-C03-R23_002965-004394	Now I am working at another university which is international as well but it has nothing to do with my university as they have radio TV [HES] department and this department has a channel where I am working at . I am working as a presenter and I am here with you [LAUGHTER]
S23-C03-R23_005395-005859	Okay, I .. was at Mass Communication, of course I was at the department of Radio and Television .
S23-C03-R23_005859-006309	I like so much something called MIC, that's why I am very happy that you are talking with me [LAUGHTER] .
S23-C03-R23_006309-006921	[HES] . My graduation project was about the effect of pictures in people's life.
S23-C03-R23_006921-008648	We have met many different people, one is old aged, other is younger and other in the mid age, so, to take the experience we have done many interviews and we took many photos and we started to do something like an intro in the beginning, talking about the impact of each photo on the people's life.
S23-C03-R23_008648-008853	We took photos for those persons who are graduated.
S23-C03-R23_008853-009244	[HES] For those who are playing a game, we think how to make the photo can leave an important memory on people's life.
S23-C03-R23_009244-009382	That was my graduation project.
S23-C03-R23_009382-010203	I was hoping and it was my dream job to be a presenter, until I got the chance and the opportunity to work at the channel in the university .. the one which I am working there till now [LAUGHTER] .
S23-C03-R23_010796-012041	Okay in the weekdays, I wake up in the morning, taking my breakfast and then, go to the work. After work, I go to the gym and then see if I have something important to do or not, if not, then, I go outside to spend a time with my friends.
S23-C03-R23_012041-012152	That is happening in the weekdays.
S23-C03-R23_012152-013317	In the weekend, I must have a vacation and travel anywhere even if it is for two days only. In winter, I don't travel anywhere, it is only gym or go out with my friends.
S23-C03-R23_013719-014750	I like swimming and dancing very much, I like riding horses as well, but, actually it is very rare to practice riding it a lot.
S23-C03-R23_015012-015287	[HES] Yes, but I don't read a lot.
S23-C03-R23_016364-016646	Look, The last book
S23-C03-R23_016646-017922	No, not the last book, but, we can say that the book which really touched me was a very different book, it is not related to increasing knowledge or information, it is a book called "Hebta", I think you will find many people know it, I felt it is a book talking about real life.
S23-C03-R23_017922-019222	It is not the best book, but, it touched me personally. I am not going to tell you a quote from this book, but, I will tell you my favorite quote which I usually follow through all my life, it said " Believe you can and you're half way there".
S23-C03-R23_020073-020486	The story of the last movie I watched.
S23-C03-R23_020486-021565	[HES] it was at the cinema, it was an Arabic film actually, not English, it is called "Men's secret club" [LAUGHTER]
S23-C03-R23_021565-021813	[HES], tell you? The story.
S23-C03-R23_021813-023079	Okay, in general, it was talking that people were different there. My friends told me to go and watch it, because they told me the boys are very very bad, and look what they are doing. Look, finally the goal of this movie that boys are having their own world.
S23-C03-R23_023079-024299	My personal opinion is how a girl can deal with boys without losing herself, and let the boy thinks by another way, and at the same time girls must think and put plans [LAUGHTER] .
S23-C03-R23_024782-024930	Very much, I like listening to songs very much.
S23-C03-R23_024930-025447	No, I like anything, Arabic and English, and any type of song, there isn't a certain type of songs.
S23-C03-R23_025447-026006	I listen to sad songs, but, I don't like to hear this type of songs a lot as it can depress me, do you understand? [LAUGHTER] .
S23-C03-R23_026597-027530	During the time of university, I was at something called .. do you want me to say its name? Okay, there was something related to the stock exchange, but, I was responsible for the Media Department there.
S23-C03-R23_027530-027943	There was another thing, yes, it was a charity, I was the one responsible for the charity there.
S23-C03-R23_027943-028479	We were helping people from .. from inside the university, the university became to have a role.
S23-C03-R23_028479-029394	[HES] there was another thing, it was entertainment, those 3 things together, those were things I liked mostly. When, I was at school, there wasn't anything from these.
S23-C03-R23_030199-030701	Look, I am here at the .. at the channel of this university, I am the presenter.
S23-C03-R23_030701-031827	Look, since I was a child, my dream job was to be a presenter, so, if I didn't take the chance to work there, I would .. actually I was asking anyone about a job, i.e. to have a job.
S23-C03-R23_031827-031900	That was really.
S23-C03-R23_031900-033526	So, till I came here, yes, I am working with the university, but, in another online channel not related to the university, so, still more than 1 person tell me that it is very difficult and it is better to leave this job, but, it is difficult to find another, then, I insist on the .. that's why here or there it will be my dream job.
S23-C03-R23_034062-034617	[HES] I have taken my internship in Berlin from a very short time.
S23-C03-R23_034617-035606	[HES] it was something related to the social media, but mostly fashion, they said as I am the presenter so, of course I will have a background about fashion and style, so, I can help.
S23-C03-R23_035606-036122	It was for two to three weeks only and returned back.
S23-C03-R23_037224-038067	Look, every stage has its own positive points, I miss those days. When I was a student I was enjoying my life, I was sleeping or going outside at any time, but, now I feel with more stress.
S23-C03-R23_038067-038447	At the time when I was a student, I was feeling with stress, but, now I know that stress is much more.
S23-C03-R23_038447-039019	You think you want to get old, want to be better, think what the next step is.
S23-C03-R23_039019-039381	This is good and that's good, but, of course what I am in is good as well.
S23-C03-R23_040089-040446	Yes, I traveled to Paris before, but, it was a from a very long time.
S23-C03-R23_040446-040700	I traveled to Berlin as well, more than 1 time.
S23-C03-R23_040700-040888	I traveled to Italy.
S23-C03-R23_040888-041012	Mostly were outings.
S23-C03-R23_041012-041485	I traveled to Malaysia because one of my relatives is from Malaysia, that's why I went there.
S23-C03-R23_041485-041622	I traveled to Thailand.
S23-C03-R23_041622-042200	[HES] Every place has its own culture, so, it is something good to know different and new things.
S23-C03-R23_043098-044149	Look, Thailand is the most different culture from us and from any other culture, because in Thailand, the religion is Buddhism., it is a very different religion.
S23-C03-R23_044149-044511	The .. [HES] the food was awful [Laughter] .
S23-C03-R23_044511-044695	Actually, I didn't find anything I can eat there.
S23-C03-R23_044695-045110	They are eating insects and uncooked food.
S23-C03-R23_045110-046353	In Malaysia, it was a little bit Asian, yes, it was similar to it, but in Malaysia is a country which has foreigners and it has everything you need. So, everything has .. has the .. things known by its country, every country has its own culture.
S23-C03-R23_046353-046533	Of course Europe is something completely different.
S23-C03-R23_046533-046696	We are talking on something completely different.
S23-C03-R23_046696-047341	Maybe what makes Asia different, that it has many activities like swimming with an elephant, or anything related to fun.
S23-C03-R23_047341-047684	But, Europe known by its high urbanization.
S23-C03-R23_048810-049010	Venice and Milano, why? Because.
S23-C03-R23_049010-050385	Why? Because, [HES] Venice it is an extremely good country, the idea that the way of your transportation is by using something like a small boat, makes you feel that everything is going with ease and lightness. Actually you can feel with a great elegance.
S23-C03-R23_050385-051211	And Milano, because it is known by fashion, and I adore something called fashion, there is an elegance in the .. in the .. in the .. way of walking, not the way to wear the clothes, but, in the way of walking itself.
S23-C03-R23_051211-051521	That is me, this is as my personality.
S23-C03-R23_052563-053339	No. At first, I will think, because it will depend on the job, what it will be this bob, if it is something I like or not? What is he language used?
S23-C03-R23_053339-053591	So, if it is Paris, I will tell you okay, because I was learning French at the school time.
S23-C03-R23_053591-053749	But, still, what will be the job?
S23-C03-R23_053749-053988	Am I going to like this job or not?
S23-C03-R23_053988-054149	Is is it good or not?
S23-C03-R23_054149-054529	Is it .. is it going to suit me or am I going to switch and change the career?
S23-C03-R23_054529-054763	All of these are going to make a difference with me, if I am going to agree or not.
S23-C03-R23_055085-055342	Traveled [HES] .
S23-C03-R23_055392-055521	Not too much as well.
S23-C03-R23_055521-055611	There are many things I don't know.
S23-C03-R23_055611-055947	I went before to Luxor and Aswan.
S23-C03-R23_055947-056169	I want to go to Dahab, I never went there.
S23-C03-R23_056169-056484	I went before to Alexandria, and all these .. known places.
S23-C03-R23_056484-056696	But, it was too many here in Egypt. [HES] .
S23-C03-R23_056696-056796	And of course I went to Fayoum before.
S23-C03-R23_056796-057091	But, I didn't go to many places here in Cairo.
S23-C03-R23_058218-058667	From 2 years ago, I had a big accident.
S23-C03-R23_058667-059000	I lost memory for we can say two or three days.
S23-C03-R23_059000-059220	Days I don't remember at all.
S23-C03-R23_059220-059501	And the accident was not here in Cairo, it happened in another governorate.
S23-C03-R23_059554-060274	[HES], I can't remember, there are many details as well I can't remember, but, I heard and I knew that I was almost near to lose my life in a second.
S23-C03-R23_060274-060755	I was receiving a treatment for 4 months, I was having many injuries in my body result from this accident.
S23-C03-R23_060755-060827	In every place in my body.
S23-C03-R23_060827-061152	Without telling you details.
S23-C03-R23_061152-062636	But, after I knew that I lost memory and I knew that it was for two three days it is a short time, so, I found that I am still able to remember any old memories except the details of the accident, that's why I asked myself why am I feeling upset? there is nothing to make me feel upset.
S23-C03-R23_062636-064213	From that time of the accident, my way of thinking changed. For example: if there is something happened that might annoy me, so, I will take the decision to think if it is something deserves to get upset on it or not. The same, if lost a job or I argued with someone, because there are other important things to thin about.
S23-C03-R23_065139-066156	Look, both are good, but, sometimes I think if I am going to work with a team so, I will depend on them, and I may not work, but, if I am going to work by myself, then, I will work more and faster. [laughter] .
S23-C03-R23_067449-067531	[HES] I usually encourage and motivate.
S23-C03-R23_067531-067694	I am from the persons who usually gives motivation to people.
S23-C03-R23_067694-068428	I have to encourage and give motivation and start by saying that if we are not going to do X, then, what can we do, trying to save what is remained [laughter] .
S23-C03-R23_069448-070244	Of course my manager, and if we are talking about someone outside the university, then, it will be of course my father and my mother.
S23-C03-R23_070244-070909	Of course because they are the ones who are usually motivate and encourage me on everything in my life whether a job, relation or anything in my life.
S23-C03-R23_070909-071319	They are the most persons who can support me, even in the worst situations. [LAUGHTER] .
S23-C03-R23_071970-072733	Respected, because if people .. if they respect you, they will be already .. already liked from .. from all the people, but, if you are liked, then, it is not a condition to be respected.
S23-C03-R23_072733-073295	You can be liked because of .. your look, something good you did, but, not for your personality.
S23-C03-R23_074459-075135	No, it is a little bit easy, because I always like to spend time at home, actually I am not very sociable with people.
S23-C03-R23_075825-076127	If it is less, no.
S23-C03-R23_076127-076655	If it is too much, so, I .. I find myself can't deal very much.
S23-C03-R23_076655-076860	I feel they are different.
S23-C03-R23_076860-077330	I feel they are in attitude where I can't be fake because there is too much fakeness.
S23-C03-R23_077946-078648	Look, it is something I like and don't like at the same time in my personality, that I am very kind with the people, and that is something .. good and bad at the same time.
S23-C03-R23_078782-078897	Why is it good?
S23-C03-R23_078897-079368	Why is it good? Because I can't leave a person who needs a help from me without supporting him/her.
S23-C03-R23_079368-080218	I, it is must be me .. It is not .. it is not something mandatory, but, I like to help, I like to work, I like to talk, I like to stand, I like like like, but, at the same time, there is a point I reach where I feel that I stressed on myself.
S23-C03-R23_080218-080570	You are kind, so, there is no problem if we stressed on her.
S23-C03-R23_081585-081744	[HES] Lying.
S23-C03-R23_082917-083238	Sometimes I feel I am cool. [Laughter] .
S23-C03-R23_083850-084056	Something weird?
S23-C03-R23_085171-086739	Look, there is something I usually do, but it is slightly weird, for example: if I bought any earring, whatever it is, there is right side and left side, so, I have to wear the right piece in the right side, and the left piece on the right side, and it must be returned, and if this not happened, then, it will be one of the big problems.
S23-C03-R23_087438-088387	[HES] if I knew that the person who is talking in front of me is lying, so, this .. this stressed me and I feel that I can't prove the oppposite.
S23-C03-R23_088848-089032	Acting [Laughter] .
S23-C03-R23_090734-091006	Yes [laughter], I usually do this.
S23-C03-R23_091006-091507	I usually interfere different topics together to show my qualifications, that I have X, Y, Z [Laughter] .
S23-C03-R23_091926-093066	Look, if I am talking with a close person, then, she will know that I am telling her fake things, but, if I talked with someone not close to me, she would get impressed with my way in thinking, and that is not real. [Laughter] .
S23-C03-R23_093306-093380	No, impossible.
S23-C03-R23_093535-093693	[HES] all my life depends on it.
S23-C03-R23_093693-093978	I have Whatsapp and Instagram, actually all my work is on it
S23-C03-R23_093978-094609	I use Instagram and social media in general for my work, so, mobile phone is all my life.
S23-C03-R23_095161-095976	Okay. I can convince you to do career shift and become presenters.
S23-C03-R23_095976-097105	Why to be presenters? Because now you if I am going to do an interview you didn't think for example [HES] I while doing this interview with her, is she a presenter or not, and then what?
S23-C03-R23_097105-097154	No.
S23-C03-R23_097154-097692	So, I see that while doing an interview with me, you put a great confidence in yourself.
S23-C03-R23_097692-097820	Arranged your questions.
S23-C03-R23_097820-098081	You did a script or both of you did a very good script.
S23-C03-R23_098081-098476	You talked with a very organized way to prove yourselves as presenters.
S23-C03-R23_098476-099232	Therefore, this makes me see that the question was arranged, everything was going organized, and the script itself was prepared, actually all the ideas are ready.
S23-C03-R23_099232-099541	So, this makes me feel convinced that you can be presenters.
S23-C03-R23_099541-099962	So, this can make you ask yourselves, why am I not be a presenter?
S23-C03-R23_099962-101181	I succeeded in .. in the .. in the thing I am doing, and in asking her the questions and she answered all the questions, and we didn't feel that she lost, but on the other hand I found that everything was going smoothly and arranged, and that of course will let you feel self confidence to become presenters.
S23-C03-R23_102011-102309	It is not related to the certificate at all.
S23-C03-R23_102309-103058	Yes, I am a Masscom graduate, but all .. half the number of the people .. half the number of people who work in this field
S23-C03-R23_103058-103201	The talent and self confidence.
S23-C03-R23_103201-103844	If you felt with a high self confidence, then, this will help to let you become a presenter. [Laughter] .
S27-C03-R27_001767-001875	I am from Alexandria.
S27-C03-R27_002001-002716	My background is I was at national school, English only.
S27-C03-R27_003562-004153	I went to the university .. Faculty of Engineering, I already took the decision to go to the Faculty of Engineering.
S27-C03-R27_004153-004997	In the beginning, I took the decision to go to Mechatronics and then I took the decision to switch to another department.
S27-C03-R27_004997-005525	By studying, I liked Computer Engineering in general, Computer Science as programming in specific.
S27-C03-R27_005525-006920	So, I shifted .. I shifted the major, and I decided to study Computer Science. Later on, I decided to shift the major once again, I decided to change and study another subjects in Computer Science, because I liked to study these subjects.
S27-C03-R27_006920-007791	That's it .. that happened at the 2nd year .. the decision .. I took the decision from the 2nd year at university, but actually after the first term I felt I need to change and shift to another section.
S27-C03-R27_008892-009255	What are we studying in Computer Science?
S27-C03-R27_009255-010837	Okay. It is mainly programming and then we have studied theoretical subjects related to computer and Computer Programming. And then, we studied things related to Signals Audio Video processing and image processing.
S27-C03-R27_010837-011349	[HUM] and mainly this is what we have taken and studied or we can say this is what at least I enjoyed or cared to study.
S27-C03-R27_011349-011701	Moreover, there were courses about course hardware, but, I didn't enjoy or care studying it.
S27-C03-R27_011860-013459	[HUM] my Bachelor project was talking about HCI and Machine Learning and Image processing all together. It was a Facial Emotion Recognition, and it wasn't here in Egypt, it was at a university in Germany in Stuttgart.
S27-C03-R27_013459-014077	I have worked on this project, doing research for 3 months and implementation for another 3 months and that's it.
S27-C03-R27_014077-014363	That .. that's what I remember about my project.
S27-C03-R27_014363-014641	And by the end of this project, we got output only.
S27-C03-R27_014912-016389	[HUM] Oh [HUM] later on, I decided to continue my study and do Masters as long as I liked the academic field because I liked doing research and reading papers. In general, research is even more important than the idea of teaching itself.
S27-C03-R27_016389-017435	I liked the academic field very much because I felt with the creativity, and everyday I read and learn new things and I can shift the field easily, without doing any modularity things.
S27-C03-R27_018079-019184	[HUM] my daily routine, when I wake up in the morning, I take a shower and go to the work, except at the weekends, so, I .. go to my work.
S27-C03-R27_019184-019973	If I had time, I would drink coffee, and then start my work, if not, then, I start my work and during a free time I bring a coffee.
S27-C03-R27_019973-020665	But, it is a must to have a coffee in the first 2 hours of my life and then continue my work, and later on after 4 or 5 hours I have coffee as well.
S27-C03-R27_020665-021202	So, we can say that coffee is from the main things at my work, because it helps me to continue working.
S27-C03-R27_021202-022463	But, sometimes I don't take my breakfast. Breakfast is not a part from my daily routine. From my routine, once I woke up, it is a must to listen to songs, and these songs affect me positively while working or not.
S27-C03-R27_022463-023550	I always listen to songs, [HUM] .. songs help me to concentrate. Listening to songs help me to concentrate faster and help me to feel relax.
S27-C03-R27_023550-024037	That's my daily routine .. my routine depends mainly on coffee and music.
S27-C03-R27_024736-025647	[HUM] I listen more to Arabic songs because I like old Arabic songs .. I listen to any singer, so, I can't tell you a specific one whom I listen to.
S27-C03-R27_025647-027061	I can tell you a name, but, we can't say that this is the only singer whom I listen to his songs only and all the time, I like to hear many singers .. but mostly, I listen to Arabic songs and oriental music. If I got a chance to attend an oriental musical concert, I wouldn't miss this chance and go immediately.
S27-C03-R27_027776-028448	In the weekends, I return back to my family in Alexandria, as I am .. I am not from Cairo.
S27-C03-R27_028448-028964	[HUM] A whole day I spend with my friends, at one of our friend's home.
S27-C03-R27_028964-029310	I spend all the day and return back home late at night.
S27-C03-R27_029310-030238	I spend all the Saturday with my family and mainly on every Saturday there are football games, so on Saturday I watch football games and spend the day with my family.
S27-C03-R27_030608-032441	Yes, it is included in my day, but, it is not everyday, At least I read a book in a month, and most of the books I read are novels whether Arabic or English, there is nothing specific. Also, as I like writing, so, reading is very important for me.
S27-C03-R27_033069-034804	[HUM] No, I don't read books to .. I mean, for me books help me to increase experiences more than taking a specific quote. What attracts me is the story itself, not a certain quote, actually I don't concentrate on quotes while reading a book.
S27-C03-R27_034804-035435	We can say that writing may help me to improve my way in writing, but, this doesn't mean borrow (quotation) any specific part from a book I read before.
S27-C03-R27_036123-037731	[HUM] Okay. There is a book I have read from few months ago, it is not the last book I read, but it is .. it is from the books that influenced me, it is a book for Tawfik El Hakem called "People of the Cave".
S27-C03-R27_037731-038361	It is talking about the story of the "People of the cave" which is almost mentioned in all religions, but, the idea that he wrote it by a different way.
S27-C03-R27_038361-040654	He imagined the characters of the story as if they are real persons we know or they are existing in this era. He started to imagine if those persons woke up and started to see things related to the real world they were already exist in from hundreds or thousands years ago .. I can't remember the number of years .. but the idea is how those persons are going to interact in the 2 eras.
S27-C03-R27_040654-043123	Because those persons are going to interact and according to the values they knew, they found everything changed and the society itself changed .. although this new society is the one they hoped to live in, but they found themselves can't adapt and there is a struggle inside them between this is the society they wished to live in before and their disability to adapt this new situation, although they woke up young aged .. without any change.
S27-C03-R27_044594-044942	[HUM] there is a movie called The Perks of being a Wallflower.
S27-C03-R27_044942-045663	[HUM] the movie is good, because it is talking about unsocial (introvert) person who is suffering from some psychological problems.
S27-C03-R27_045663-046223	But, the main idea, I don't care to watch movies talking about unsocial persons.
S27-C03-R27_046223-046813	Mostly because .. they mainly focus on stories talking about social problems more than stories talking about introvert (unsocial) persons.
S27-C03-R27_046813-047620	The character in the movie was suffering from a big problem during his high school, and the film showed us how this person started to deal with the situation .. the story itself contains many details.
S27-C03-R27_047620-048292	But, it was a good movie, and its story is written in a book, and I read this book after watched the movie.
S27-C03-R27_049069-049478	[HUM] Musician.
S27-C03-R27_049478-049813	[HUM] I like music.
S27-C03-R27_049813-051255	I play music a little, but the idea is I like composing and .. and singing as well, but I am not sure if singing likes me as well or not, but at least .. the other things, yes.
S27-C03-R27_051255-051923	So, .. yes, but the problem is, this needs effort and a very long time, and unfortunately we can't take all the things together.
S27-C03-R27_052765-054119	Okay. Once before I did internship at .. at Petroleum Company [HUM] in a desert in Hurghada at the mountains and it was something a little bit weird because it was something like a camp.
S27-C03-R27_054119-054782	People there live like that, they live for 2 to 3 weeks and then, 2 to 3 weeks at their place as a vacation.
S27-C03-R27_054782-056600	It was an experience, it was .. I was living alone by myself, and actually that doesn't matter with me, to accept the idea that I am living alone in a place away from any other people. You are living in a very little place, and that's .. that's all you know about the place you are working in, and it was a little bit weird.
S27-C03-R27_056600-058263	It is not a must to learn something new, I might learn skills like technical work, I don't know how to rate my experience, but all I am sure about is I am not going to live this life, so, I took the decision to not work by this .. by this way or routine, i.e. a place of work and at the same time the place to take a vacation.
S27-C03-R27_059550-060361	[HUM] maybe it is my life when I was a student, because I didn't feel with the pressure of studying and projects.
S27-C03-R27_060361-060543	Pressure is not affecting me a lot.
S27-C03-R27_060543-061453	So .. before, I didn't have responsibilities verses nowadays, I am responsible on myself, although I am living alone by myself, but, before, the responsibilities were not too much like today.
S27-C03-R27_061453-062305	Before, I was having the idea that for example: I am not able to do X now, I can do it later, but, now the situation is different, I can't do this and delay doing something, because actually I have many things must be done.
S27-C03-R27_062305-063555	I mean I have to prepare the tutorial .. before, if I didn't study, then, it would affect me by not getting high grades, but nowadays, I have to prepare it because my conscience will not allow me to teach a tutorial without being well prepared, or [HUM] to wake up or whatever .
S27-C03-R27_063555-064298	So, anyway, there is a pressure on me regarding things I have to do and rules I have to satisfy, although while I was a student, there were rules, but, it was not a must.
S27-C03-R27_064298-064963	So, I think the .. the student life was less pressure although I can't say that I am feeling upset now.
S27-C03-R27_064963-065697	I am not feeling upset, and at the same time the point of having pressure doesn't make a difference with me .. but I think it was more comfortable for me.
S27-C03-R27_066529-066836	Yes, I traveled for 6 months to do my Master project.
S27-C03-R27_067975-068126	No, tell me the next question.
S27-C03-R27_069155-070069	Okay. The point is in the experience of traveling, the point that I am living alone by myself doesn't matter for me, but at least I learned how to cook by myself.
S27-C03-R27_070069-070165	I wasn't cooking here.
S27-C03-R27_070165-070460	Although I am living alone by myself, but, I .. making order for any food.
S27-C03-R27_070460-070771	There, I learned how to cook just because there was a little free time than here.
S27-C03-R27_070771-071046	So, .. this was one of the experiences.
S27-C03-R27_071046-071623	There is something else, but it is something personal, the point is how to adapt myself alone in a place without knowing many people.
S27-C03-R27_071623-072794	How, for example .. the point you know people who are close to you plus while traveling the situation differs, people differ when they traveled and go anywhere else.
S27-C03-R27_072794-073260	[HUM] and this experience is not only in Masters, but also in Bachelor and the Master.
S27-C03-R27_073260-073612	I think it is the same idea, we are not very far.
S27-C03-R27_073612-074705	The people are very different, I mean you may find someone does something different than what he is doing here, and the oppposite, so, I have seen all the types of people.
S27-C03-R27_074705-076546	So .. that was my personal experience, I learned many things in my life, for example not to expect a lot of expectation, because I found people may change after being far away and traveled. I understood that .. whatever happens is according to the circumstances.
S27-C03-R27_077364-078679	Actually there are many places I liked there. There is a place in Switzerland called Rhine Falls, it is a water falls of a river called Rhine, and for me it is a very good place.
S27-C03-R27_078679-078931	I was going .. I was going there a lot.
S27-C03-R27_078993-080087	It is not very near to me, but .. in many times I decided to take a day off just only to go there and enjoy the natural views there, to get relaxed.
S27-C03-R27_081311-081689	[HUM] yes, if I got the chance.
S27-C03-R27_081689-081851	I already have offers.
S27-C03-R27_081851-082581	I think, I will travel just I .. am convinced with the experience found there, it is good.
S27-C03-R27_082581-083318	It is not the idea of just traveling, but it is the point that anything I need is better there.
S27-C03-R27_083318-083988	So, it will be faster, the idea is .. not easier but faster and more efficient.
S27-C03-R27_085164-087318	[HUM] The biggest turning point in my life is when I took the decision to leave my family in Alexandria, and came here to Cairo and live by myself to study in the university, so, I think this is a big decision I took, and all my life changed after this decision and even all my relations with all my friends changed, i.e. all my life changed.
S27-C03-R27_087662-088374	It made me independent person, until I reached a point where I can't be dependent anymore.
S27-C03-R27_088374-089136	And I can't live with people, I get used to live alone by myself, so, it is not the easiest thing for me.
S27-C03-R27_089136-089960	I think there are other things I liked as well, and I didn't know before that I like it I had free time so, I decided to try these new things and finally I discovered that I liked them.
S27-C03-R27_089960-091695	All my life time was with my family, so, the point to try something new was difficult to be done, but, now I am feeling free, I can go anywhere and return at anytime, and I don't have to do something on certain time.
S27-C03-R27_092488-093342	I liked to work in teams, even if the teams are not going to work or do anything. For me it is important to work in group because get bored if I worked alone.
S27-C03-R27_093342-095719	[HUM] But, I'm usually keen to know everything, and the role of everyone .. because of the details .. because the point is, as we are working in a group, so we have to collect all the work together, so, everyone must be updated .. updated to be able to complete the work and merge all things together with each other.
S27-C03-R27_095719-096517	So, I like to work in teams however .. however I don't get upset if I am going to work alone, but I prefer to work in teams.
S27-C03-R27_097410-097633	[HUM] Unfortunately, no.
S27-C03-R27_097633-099211	I feel that everyone of us has good things and bad things, so, if I found someone does something good, so, I would try to do like this person, and if he did something wrong, so, I will not neglect it and not follow him doing this.
S27-C03-R27_099211-100428	But .. but [HUM] overall I can't choose someone to be my role model, because of course this person is not an angel and not doing any mistakes or wrong things, we are humans by the end.
S27-C03-R27_101323-102757	[HUM] I will answer I'd rather be respected from all people, because I feel convinced by this.
S27-C03-R27_102757-103498	Liked, I prefer to be liked by the people around me [HUM] because in general, I try to let people respect me, I don't make a fool of myself, I always try to keep my dignity.
S27-C03-R27_103498-104111	But, for the people who are close to me, I don't want them to feel with my dignity or whatever, they are dealing with me already on a personal level.
S27-C03-R27_104111-104653	We are dealing like anyone, like .. with my family.
S27-C03-R27_104653-105997	With my family, I don't care with the point of dealing with me in respect, but, the most important is love, I don't mean liking, but, the point of love itself.
S27-C03-R27_106999-107455	No, I will need time, because I am not a sociable person with the persons whom I don't know before.
S27-C03-R27_107455-108644	So, I .. I am the type of persons who sit at a corner by myself without talking with persons I met for the 1st time, although if there are many people, then I can start to talk and share with them.
S27-C03-R27_108644-108788	But, it is not easy for me to start talking.
S27-C03-R27_108788-108942	The start is usually hard for me.
S27-C03-R27_108942-109302	I don't like to talk or share with anyone I don't know.
S27-C03-R27_110317-111239	[HUM] As I dealt with many different people because of the experiences I have.
S27-C03-R27_111239-112140	I live alone by myself and I met many people so, .. I have seen many people from different social levels and from different cultures, so, it is not social level only.
S27-C03-R27_112140-112899	It is not social level related to economic state, but I mean different social levels and different religions.
S27-C03-R27_112899-114066	Also, when I traveled, I met people there who are not of high standard level at all, and even that there was a respect in the way of dealing and that is something good, and I already have friends from there.
S27-C03-R27_115180-116313	[HUM] if this person is a close one, on a personal level, so, I don't like to be selfish person, if he is a person not close to me, then, I don't like to be stupid.
S27-C03-R27_116313-117513	I can't tolerate stupidity, if it is from a person who is not close to me, and I don't like selfishness from the close persons, because at a point, this will affect me.
S27-C03-R27_118405-119645	[HUM] we can say emotional problems whether with my family, God or with my friends, other than that I don't feel with stress, neither work nor study can let m feel with stress.
S27-C03-R27_119645-119816	[HUM] maybe.
S27-C03-R27_119816-120106	As it is emotional, so, we can say it is loneliness as well.
S27-C03-R27_120106-120195	So, it is this or that.
S27-C03-R27_120195-121019	So, it could be the point of loneliness or if I have emotional problem with .. with the persons who are close to me.
S27-C03-R27_122598-122990	[HUM], Definitely, I am not saying any non understandable things.
S27-C03-R27_123042-123473	I say words to the point, but it is not a must that these are the words the want to hear.
S27-C03-R27_123473-123763	[HUM] But, yes, I may do this.
S27-C03-R27_123763-123903	Or did that.
S27-C03-R27_123903-124126	But, not to say non understandable words.
S27-C03-R27_124126-125094	Because I am sure that this person sits in front me, has a great experience and he is able to evaluate me, so, for sure he will understand anything I am going to say, and will catch me if I am saying any meaningless words.
S27-C03-R27_125094-125595	And as I mentioned before that it is important for me to find people respect me, so, I am not going to lose my dignity.
S27-C03-R27_125595-125939	And at this point, I will say this evaluation is not important for me to be done.
S27-C03-R27_126308-126542	I don't know.
S27-C03-R27_126542-127422	[HUM] I .. I didn't use social .. social networks for a very long time before, so, it's no problem, that was for months.
S27-C03-R27_127422-127600	No, I didn't get upset.
S27-C03-R27_127600-128465	But, I think without using mobile, there must be a different life to live.
S27-C03-R27_128465-129292	By this way, I will not be able to work as TA and the mobile phone is not going to be a part of my life, and will not be a way helps to communicate with others.
S27-C03-R27_129292-129742	But .. is the telephone will be available?
S27-C03-R27_129786-129982	I mean, I can contact other people easily, right?
S27-C03-R27_129982-130489	So, yes, there is no problem as long as there is another way of communication that can help me to contact with others.
S27-C03-R27_130489-130576	It is not a must to have a mobile phone.
S27-C03-R27_130576-130733	So, the most important for me, that there is a way I can reach them.
S27-C03-R27_132059-132763	Okay. So, I will try to convince you to continue you career as an academic field, and not continue in this regular type of work.
S27-C03-R27_132852-134354	[HUM] Why? Because we are living in Egypt, and as we're both working in the same field, the .. the available opportunities are [HUM] in jobs that are repetitive .
S27-C03-R27_134354-135511	So, in academic field, we don't have opportunities in the field of industry and it is something routine, it is not repeated and there is a creativity.
S27-C03-R27_135511-136377	The only thing that is characterized by creativity without boring is the research in general and the academic life.
S27-C03-R27_136377-137018	Because in the academic life, you are dealing with students and doctors every day.
S27-C03-R27_137018-138403	And when attending conferences, you should ideally attend many conferences so you get to know people from different universities, different networks, different social levels with different cultures.
S27-C03-R27_138403-138658	So, this is a good and comfortable.
S27-C03-R27_138658-139233	Plus there isn't the concept of deadlines, where you're supposed to have a certain task that should be done by a certain time because the
S27-C03-R27_139233-139485	No, in the academic life, you are feeling free.
S27-C03-R27_139485-141179	That is if you want to .. want to .. you're the doctor, so you're in control of the course, if you want to modify it, you want to be more creative, you want to do some research, and if you get tired of research, then you can take some time off research and continue teaching and that's it.
S27-C03-R27_141179-141762	You are the one who can control and mange the time, and after you finished teaching, then, you can go without any control.
S27-C03-R27_141762-142378	But, here in Egypt, at least if you are having a task, then, you have to do all your best until completing it.
S27-C03-R27_142378-142991	You may need to stay at night working, you are going to live or die, but, the most important is to finish your task.
S27-C03-R27_142991-143834	Plus, you are going to have this type of clients who are going to ask you to change the things they need and you are going to start to repeat the work you did again, and this is not found here with us.
S27-C03-R27_143834-144010	You .. you are the one who did your own research.
S27-C03-R27_144010-144435	You .. you are the one who thought in the idea and took the decision.
S27-C03-R27_144435-144641	So, you are the one who implement your own idea.
S27-C03-R27_144641-144799	You are the one who know how to do it.
S27-C03-R27_144799-145028	You go and present your own idea.
S27-C03-R27_145028-145175	You are the one who have a control on himself.
S27-C03-R27_145175-145574	And I think, the point of academic has no boss.
S27-C03-R27_145574-147322	There is a boss, who is for sure higher than you in the position, but the way of dealing is not .. is not related by .. you are doctor like him, you have publications and he has publications as well, so, bot of you are talking on academic level, it is not like an order and you have to do.
S27-C03-R27_147322-147551	This is not available in the academic life at all.
S27-C03-R27_147551-149333	So, I would recommend you to start doing Masters, and you are not going to lose anything, at least you are going to try new fields and this will help you to know what you like most, because I don’t think the Bachelor studies are enough to help you what you need to do at least at the place we are in.
S27-C03-R27_149333-149688	And maybe .. at that time decide.
S27-C03-R27_149688-150531	Or most of the people who do Masters and research like the .. the .. like more the academic career.
S27-C03-R27_150531-152226	And if you didn't like, you are not going to lose anything, you have a degree, and with this degree you will be able to use it at any other place, plus you are better than other people, because you have a degree which is something not the certificate itself, but, you learned as well and you are developed at this period of time.
S39-C03-R39_001582-001892	I am from Nasr City .. Cairo, Nasr City.
S39-C03-R39_001892-002400	I was going to national school, and I was studying English and French.
S39-C03-R39_003277-004671	Since I was at secondary stage, I .. I went to the faculty of Commerce, English section .. when, I was at the secondary stage, I was studying Biology, but, I liked to go faculty of commerce English section, and at the same time I want to study Biology, but, I don't want to go to the Faculty of Pharmacy.
S39-C03-R39_004671-005203	So, since I was at the secondary stage I took my decision to go to the faculty of Commerce English section, even, if I got high grade, and this is what I done, thanks God.
S39-C03-R39_005860-006489	I have a baby and he is the one who wakes me up very very early.
S39-C03-R39_006489-007194	We wake up preparing the breakfast, then, we wear our clothes and go outside to arrive my baby to the nursery and then arrive to work.
S39-C03-R39_007570-008445	Yes, for sure there must be a day specific for my son, to go outside together, something suitable for his age, and another day for an outing with our friends.
S39-C03-R39_008630-008795	No. [LAUGHTER]
S39-C03-R39_009527-009791	No skip I remember nothing.

S39-C03-R39_012201-012587	I will enroll him God's willing in French international.
S39-C03-R39_012587-013989	Why? because my husband was French and I can see that it was very beneficial at work, so to be second .. language first and English to be second he would still be good at both that's why I will enroll him in french.
S39-C03-R39_014732-015229	Well, I have always wanted to be an accountant in a company.
S39-C03-R39_015229-015904	My father wanted me to work at banks but I didn't want banks system so I was determined to work at a company.
S39-C03-R39_016968-018033	Yes, for sure I did internships when I was at college and it was in banks after finishing college I worked at a company it was my first job and then I worked here.
S39-C03-R39_019169-020794	No I prefer my life when I was a student honestly, because the responsibility was less, at work definitely the responsibility is much more and then I got married and have a baby so no frankly before life was much better .
S39-C03-R39_021068-021286	Yes, I have traveled before.
S39-C03-R39_021847-022342	I traveled to Thailand .. traveled to Thailand.
S39-C03-R39_022342-023585	And definitely I don't want to go there once more it's once and that's it [HES] it was very beautiful and I would like to see another country God's willing actually Spain would be the next step.
S39-C03-R39_024962-025485	Definitely I will do this because I need a better future for my son.
S39-C03-R39_025485-026029	And he will affect my decision whether the country is suitable to live in it with my husband, and my son or not.
S39-C03-R39_026029-026363	The country is okay, there is no problem and there would be better future for my son.
S39-C03-R39_026363-026539	Definitely, I will go of course God's willing.
S39-C03-R39_027260-028248	Look there is more than one place, in Spain, and in France, and in Italy a new country actually.
S39-C03-R39_028248-028977	Why? to see new things. monuments there, outings there, different life, it's different than Egypt actually.
S39-C03-R39_029305-029406	Yes.
S39-C03-R39_030200-031091	Well, it's the favorite place for me for me I have to travel to El Gouna once per year I mean for 4 years we have to travel to El Gouna every year.
S39-C03-R39_031091-031518	[HES] this is the place we enjoy visiting the most in Egypt.
S39-C03-R39_032162-032661	When I gave birth [Laughter] when I gave birth, it was a turning point in my life actually.
S39-C03-R39_032928-033160	What changed in my character?
S39-C03-R39_033160-034268	I felt that I'm the life for someone else, I mean he depends on me in everything I have no idea .. I mean I can't do anything without him for example so it was the turning point in my life for example.
S39-C03-R39_034947-036200	[HES] no at college I liked working in teams because we come up with new ideas with each other, help each other, we think in different directions which makes us see different things that I didn't see alone. So, working in teams is of course much better.
S39-C03-R39_037093-037394	My father, my father is my role model.
S39-C03-R39_037394-037641	He is the best person I have ever seen in you life.
S39-C03-R39_037641-038249	There is someone at work also reminds me of my father, as well I haven't seen anybody like him.
S39-C03-R39_038249-039613	[HES] he is a respected person, that help people, who make no harm to anybody, he is a person who do good for others, so actually both of them are the best people I have ever seen in life.
S39-C03-R39_040065-040173	Respected.
S39-C03-R39_040173-041559	Respected is .. forced to like me I mean forced %h .. he will look good to me but like this is not anybody,, I mean I can't like you, but respect if you are fine that's it I will respect .
S39-C03-R39_042152-044265	[Cough] well I took time slightly till understanding the other person but it's fine %h .. %h I mean I will go on with him, If I don't feet at ease there would be boundaries so I take time and people get to know me say that we thought that we were totally different it's only to know if the other person is good or not.
S39-C03-R39_045163-046985	It can be if I felt that he is a person who doesn't want good for others or who is gossiping about people, if I shared something with him and I knew that he shared it with others which actually happened before and is currently actually happening with someone, that's it will be closed his file that's it I don't want to know him again.
S39-C03-R39_047887-049348	Me for example like to keep actually .. I mean keep secrets and like good for others these are the two things that I like to find in others and like good for others thank God really.
S39-C03-R39_050394-051329	No no I have no problem in this issue, I can adapt with others, I mean it's normal .
S39-C03-R39_051922-052993	Work and the .. home responsibility, the baby I mean not responsibility .. the baby these are the most things .. both together sometime I need to slightly take a break, so the issue is very hard actually.
S39-C03-R39_053413-055252	Well, it's of course [HES] I mean try actually because my son doesn't spend much time with me so I try after returning back %b .. spend all time with him as I mentioned that on weekend and we go out with him to compensate him that we don't spend much time with him during the week.
S39-C03-R39_055252-055894	The work you are at work so there is no problem but it's %k .. stress no more.
S39-C03-R39_057336-058682	No, I have just been in this problem recently and I said I have no idea that's it actually I mean it's not .. not I will not be able to talk and it seems that I don't know so that's it I will not embarrass myself and I don't know there is no problem actually [LAUGHTER] .
S39-C03-R39_059352-059650	No, no he accepted that there is no problem, he asked me another question.
S39-C03-R39_060156-060363	No, I can't live without a mobile.
S39-C03-R39_060363-061120	Why because I will feel that it's safe for people who will be far away from me, I mean my son, husband and parents.
S39-C03-R39_061120-062480	I can go to my parents but sometimes for example when I'm tired it's much easier to call him so the mobile is something crucial now. no no [laughter] .
S39-C03-R39_063474-063793	You have to travel abroad [Laughter]
S39-C03-R39_063793-064470	You have to travel abroad I mean we are older than you and we are trying to take this step actually.
S39-C03-R39_065876-066031	And the education is much better
S39-C03-R39_066031-066688	And what I'm paying as well may be is not equivalent of what I'm getting.
S39-C03-R39_066688-067300	So, currently I focus on my son this is the step in which I'm in right now I want him to live a life hundred times better than me.
S39-C03-R39_068279-068453	For better future God's willing
