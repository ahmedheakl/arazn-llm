S04-C03-R04_000953-001180	Okay I was born in Cairo.
S04-C03-R04_001180-001848	And my education was in language schools till third preparatory.
S04-C03-R04_001848-002019	And afterwards I entered IG.
S04-C03-R04_002019-002363	Till, I mean, I finished the three years of IG and I entered college.
S04-C03-R04_002621-002966	At first I was national, then the last three years it was international.
S04-C03-R04_004006-004371	Okay my faculty itself is called Media Computer Technology.
S04-C03-R04_004371-004580	And the major is computer science.
S04-C03-R04_004580-005165	And in general we study things related to software and hardware.
S04-C03-R04_005165-005285	But mainly software.
S04-C03-R04_005285-005464	We study very few things related to hardware.
S04-C03-R04_006215-006445	It was by exclusion honestly.
S04-C03-R04_006445-007202	I mean there were other options or majors that I don't want so in the end MET was the most appropriate option for me.
S04-C03-R04_007670-008110	Okay I wake up and have my breakfast.
S04-C03-R04_008110-008213	I can take a shower.
S04-C03-R04_008213-008553	And then I dress up and go out.
S04-C03-R04_009194-009880	((There is nothing consistent)), I mean, but sometimes I can attend zumba classes.
S04-C03-R04_009880-010385	I can go jogging in the club for a while, I can draw, that's it.
S04-C03-R04_010561-010677	Yes, very much.
S04-C03-R04_011118-011457	The thing I like the most is mainly Arabic.
S04-C03-R04_011457-011631	I like reading Arabic very much.
S04-C03-R04_011631-012393	And I like the concept of novels, I do not like reading just because it provides info or so.
S04-C03-R04_012393-012556	I like the story.
S04-C03-R04_012556-012836	Sometimes I read English as well but not so much, not as much as Arabic.
S04-C03-R04_013470-013683	God's land.
S04-C03-R04_013683-013815	It's very good.
S04-C03-R04_013815-015214	It was little about Egypt's history and about things meaning about falsifications happened in history and how can such falsifications affected the concept the Egyptians are adopting about Egypt.
S04-C03-R04_015618-015706	Of course.
S04-C03-R04_016033-016169	No.
S04-C03-R04_016374-016431	Both.
S04-C03-R04_018212-020110	There's a club in which I'm a member, actually it %bey it's mainly about sport and organizes sports events, but it also supports other things actually, such as mental illness, such general things, I mean.
S04-C03-R04_020110-020404	Things that occupy people a lot the past period.
S04-C03-R04_020404-020728	We target to support this issue.
S04-C03-R04_020728-021633	And %n and we try to have a role whether by runs or by certain events to do fundraising and so on.
S04-C03-R04_021633-021932	And other things that I might not be a member in but I like attending it.
S04-C03-R04_021932-022163	I mean things related to the event of charity.
S04-C03-R04_022163-022327	I do not really like being in a club itself.
S04-C03-R04_022327-022674	But I attend their events because I like participating in it.
S04-C03-R04_023135-023446	Good question.
S04-C03-R04_023446-023718	Okay the most movie?
S04-C03-R04_023718-023921	But there are too many.
S04-C03-R04_023921-024396	Maybe My Name Is Khan.
S04-C03-R04_024523-024616	Very good.
S04-C03-R04_024616-024864	I like it because its story moves me.
S04-C03-R04_024864-025329	And I mean it isn't one movie.
S04-C03-R04_025329-025414	There are many movies.
S04-C03-R04_025414-025717	The point is that I like deep things.
S04-C03-R04_025717-025947	Things that are not superficial.
S04-C03-R04_025947-026670	I mean there are original stories that are not imitated where the acting is good and that's it and the story itself is nice.
S04-C03-R04_027104-027499	It is about a man called Khan he is supposed to be Muslim.
S04-C03-R04_027499-027846	But the last time I watched it was a long time ago.
S04-C03-R04_027846-028632	The idea is that he was fighting discrimination against muslims taking place in areas where he lived in.
S04-C03-R04_028632-028900	That he is not not not a terrorist, I mean.
S04-C03-R04_028900-029140	He is a normal person, who is living normally.
S04-C03-R04_029140-029359	But all people perceive him as a terrorist.
S04-C03-R04_029359-029579	So that was the most thing that impacted me.
S04-C03-R04_031143-031640	Okay I think that this issue will proceed as for me, I prefer that it proceeds as phases.
S04-C03-R04_031640-032107	I do not like that I mean there is nothing that I want to achieve so I will ((work on)) it.
S04-C03-R04_032222-032766	I want to complete the master and the PhD and take the academic career path till the end and to see to what I can reach.
S04-C03-R04_032766-033553	Then I can use the knowledge that I got from this phase to work in a company or start my own business.
S04-C03-R04_034631-035395	No the most thing I like is to work either I mean in a group that I feel very comfortable with or to work alone.
S04-C03-R04_035395-035606	But mainly individual is better.
S04-C03-R04_035799-036041	Because I'm in control of the whole issue.
S04-C03-R04_036041-036672	I am not waiting for someone else to kindly do something so that we get things done I mean.
S04-C03-R04_037415-037713	I did several internships.
S04-C03-R04_037713-037941	The best one was in IBM.
S04-C03-R04_037941-038043	It was the year before last one.
S04-C03-R04_038043-038282	It involved a big group of people.
S04-C03-R04_038282-038488	And it was very good experience.
S04-C03-R04_038488-038663	I learned many things that I hadn't studied yet at the university.
S04-C03-R04_038663-039081	And there was another internship last year.
S04-C03-R04_039081-039388	It as in a data company.
S04-C03-R04_039388-039565	I mean it's mainly data manipulation.
S04-C03-R04_039565-040034	But the thing I remember the most was that of IBM.
S04-C03-R04_040406-040543	Yes several times.
S04-C03-R04_040675-041178	And I was grown up and aware it was in France.
S04-C03-R04_041178-041637	And I traveled internally in Egypt a lot.
S04-C03-R04_041637-042273	I like going to Dahab and Luxor and Aswan and places in Egypt and Alexandria Marsa Matrouh Marsa Allam these places.
S04-C03-R04_042874-043007	Aswan.
S04-C03-R04_043104-043314	Aswan for me is charming city.
S04-C03-R04_043532-043734	That we have such a place in Egypt.
S04-C03-R04_043734-044008	I could not imagine that there is such a beautiful place in Egypt.
S04-C03-R04_044008-045138	That you go and watch the nile's nature and very natural things and the Nubian people and the Nuba and their houses for me was an amazing experience.
S04-C03-R04_046156-046990	Actually, I cannot determine right now because I have not tried living abroad for a long time.
S04-C03-R04_046990-047361	So I cannot say whether I can live abroad for the rest of my life or not.
S04-C03-R04_047361-047651	So this is something that I cannot determine now.
S04-C03-R04_048675-049174	Look, initially that you the idea of you going to and seeing a new place is an experience in itself.
S04-C03-R04_049174-050273	To see how people deal with each other there and how they live and whether their life is easier or more difficult and different than yours and so on.
S04-C03-R04_050273-050681	This, for us, is a complete experience.
S04-C03-R04_050681-051010	Their cuisine and drinks and the place where they live and how they deal with each other.
S04-C03-R04_051010-051205	What is acceptable for them and what is not.
S04-C03-R04_051205-051728	You feel like you see how human nature can be impacted by the surroundings.
S04-C03-R04_052971-053416	When I newly joined the university it was on the basis that I will enroll in architecture.
S04-C03-R04_053529-053804	And I have been several years in architecture.
S04-C03-R04_053850-054268	And I joined exactly for two weeks and I felt that I am not comfortable in architecture.
S04-C03-R04_054333-054555	So that was a a huge turning point in my life.
S04-C03-R04_054555-055125	It was like I have always been moving in a direction and suddenly, that's it, I don't want that direction, I do not like it anymore.
S04-C03-R04_055125-055349	So I need to look for another direction.
S04-C03-R04_055349-055525	And there are several directions that you can follow.
S04-C03-R04_055525-055962	So this was the point that changed my entire life the most.
S04-C03-R04_056622-056877	I can't be of any help in that honestly.
S04-C03-R04_058050-058972	For sure, simply because you were so confident of your decision to the extent that you believe in it and follow it whereas all at once no this is not what you want.
S04-C03-R04_058972-059118	So you were initially not fully comprehending yourself.
S04-C03-R04_059118-059308	So this is another disaster.
S04-C03-R04_059308-059515	This is another issue you should be focusing on.
S04-C03-R04_059515-059684	So of course my character has changed.
S04-C03-R04_060710-061162	Well I have a concept in my life that no body is perfect.
S04-C03-R04_061162-061513	So I always focus on the good in everything.
S04-C03-R04_061513-062008	I mean there can be one good thing in the other person that I wish to acquire.
S04-C03-R04_062008-062427	But to have a person who I want resemble in everything, this never happened.
S04-C03-R04_063879-064501	Punctuality at work for me Dr. Slim is a role model honestly, because he knows quite well what he is doing.
S04-C03-R04_064501-064887	He plans for his work and ((things are organized)) .
S04-C03-R04_064887-065059	And knows how to deal with human beings.
S04-C03-R04_065059-065280	And what works with that person and what doesn't work with that person.
S04-C03-R04_065395-065690	So, so far, I mean, for me, my role model at the university Dr. Slim
S04-C03-R04_065690-065826	In terms of work.
S04-C03-R04_066630-066756	No.
S04-C03-R04_068845-069445	In terms of work honestly I'd rather that they would respect me so as to get work done.
S04-C03-R04_069445-069863	I mean what shall I gain when they like me and the work doesn't get done.
S04-C03-R04_069965-070306	Of course it's important that they like you.
S04-C03-R04_070306-071095	But if they are actually professional people, they would understand why I'm acting that way.
S04-C03-R04_071095-071325	So they will like me but in a different way.
S04-C03-R04_072469-072696	I mean, I believe that it's easy.
S04-C03-R04_072696-072873	But there are people that don't see that I mean.
S04-C03-R04_072873-072990	I don't know I mean.
S04-C03-R04_072990-073283	I mean I never block someone trying to approach me.
S04-C03-R04_073283-073427	I start a conversation.
S04-C03-R04_073427-074081	And I try when I meet someone for the first time to avoid awkward silent moments.
S04-C03-R04_074081-074307	So I believe it is better.
S04-C03-R04_075386-075677	I mean if they were this has nothing to do with the social level by the way.
S04-C03-R04_075677-075939	It's related to the personality of the person himself.
S04-C03-R04_075939-076462	I mean some people aren't are the ones who don't accept dealing with another level
S04-C03-R04_076462-076647	Even lower or higher
S04-C03-R04_076647-077706	I mean they either believe that the person I'm dealing with is much better than me so I can't talk to him or that he is much lower than me so I will be afraid to talk to him or I will not want to talk to him or something of that sort.
S04-C03-R04_077706-077875	But I do not have this attitude.
S04-C03-R04_077875-078106	I mean I can easily talk with anybody.
S04-C03-R04_079605-079863	Vulgar people.
S04-C03-R04_079863-080484	I mean a person who doesn't have the sense of ethics and morals and so.
S04-C03-R04_080484-080913	So that person, I mean, I avoid his ((foul language)) .
S04-C03-R04_080913-081014	I ((have nothing to do with him)) .
S04-C03-R04_081014-081277	As long as ((you use foul language)), so I'd better not talk to you.
S04-C03-R04_082339-082771	Modesty [LAUGHTER] .
S04-C03-R04_082771-083517	I mean the thing I notice the most in myself is that I believe I am very kind.
S04-C03-R04_083830-084275	I don't know, honestly, but I feel that I'm not always considerate.
S04-C03-R04_084275-084723	I feel that I know his limits with me and I know my limit with him.
S04-C03-R04_084723-085301	So I try to respect his feelings and maintain our relationship.
S04-C03-R04_085301-085583	I don't hurt him in any way, I mean with any word, with any gesture, even with any look.
S04-C03-R04_086406-086622	Sometimes I have a crazy mood I mean.
S04-C03-R04_086622-087501	Sometimes I do you know these moments of glory? Sometimes I get it.
S04-C03-R04_087501-087634	But they are few days I mean.
S04-C03-R04_087634-088656	I mean I can be dealing very spontaneously so the other person who doesn't know me well and is not familiar with my way I'm afraid he gets astonished
S04-C03-R04_089354-089479	When I have something to be done and I can't do it.
S04-C03-R04_089479-089632	Or I don't know how to start.
S04-C03-R04_089819-090061	And I swear it ((goes like that)), I mean, God's will.
S04-C03-R04_090061-090432	It isn't .. I mean it's nothing standard that I always do.
S04-C03-R04_091834-092045	No I mean maybe in evaluations.
S04-C03-R04_092045-092258	I mean English is not my escape.
S04-C03-R04_092403-092956	I try to complicate the issue so that he might not understand and let me pass.
S04-C03-R04_093283-093368	I hope so.
S04-C03-R04_093368-093521	I really hope so, I swear.
S04-C03-R04_093671-094124	Because I feel that it consumes so much time from our lives.
S04-C03-R04_094124-094723	I mean really really when it doesn't work for instance or so I realize I hold my mobile too long.
S04-C03-R04_094723-095209	You can hold it more than ten times per hour.
S04-C03-R04_095209-095327	This is a lot.
S04-C03-R04_095327-096225	It consumes our time, I mean in some cases when some big accidents occur I would have never seen such scenes unless I have this device with me.
S04-C03-R04_096225-096747	So really we get misery that we don't we wouldn't have lived if we didn't have it.
S04-C03-R04_096747-097051	Yes we get happiness that we wouldn't have felt but not as much as misery I mean.
S04-C03-R04_097051-097404	It might actually be a trauma as a result of what you have seen.
S04-C03-R04_097404-097873	I mean no, not not I mean I really wish I can live without it.
S04-C03-R04_099414-099855	I can convince you that you can sell your project to the CNN.
S04-C03-R04_100185-101133	I will tell you that they do a lot of interviews, so they will always want to know the personality of people they meet and talk to.
S04-C03-R04_101133-101326	Especially in case of important people.
S04-C03-R04_101326-101611	They would want to know their patterns of talking.
S04-C03-R04_101611-101939	And when they respond in a certain way and when they don't.
S04-C03-R04_101939-102705	So that when they conduct interviews later on they would know when to ask certain questions and how to ask it and to ask it in what pace and what thing.
S04-C03-R04_102705-102864	So for sure this is something that will benefit them.
S04-C03-R04_102864-102920	Am I right or not?
S04-C03-R04_103349-103418	Welcome.
S04-C03-R04_103418-103478	Bye.
S08-C03-R08_001771-002000	I was born in Menofia.
S08-C03-R08_002000-002660	My school was national till third preparatory then I became international in first secondary, I joined IG.
S08-C03-R08_002660-002895	Then I completed university.
S08-C03-R08_004334-004531	My major is computer science.
S08-C03-R08_004531-004936	I chose this major because it was the second best major for me.
S08-C03-R08_004936-005471	I wanted a major involving physics but I couldn't find one and I like computer so I joined computer science.
S08-C03-R08_006152-007123	In semester 3 when I had to choose major so I had to choose my major so I found that computer science is the best major for me at this university.
S08-C03-R08_008331-009131	I study software and hardware but mostly software, mainly because we will be software developers.
S08-C03-R08_009131-009444	My bachelor is about reasoning about vision.
S08-C03-R08_009444-010683	It is about if I have a scene 2D I can reason about, which is to explain the .. the scene into 2D with some notations.
S08-C03-R08_011993-012620	I wake up in the morning the first thing I do is drink Nescafe then after one hour or so I can have breakfast.
S08-C03-R08_012620-012874	Then I see if I have studying to do.
S08-C03-R08_012874-013420	I check then the appointments I have till night, till I go to sleep.
S08-C03-R08_013420-013680	But it depends on how the day is organized.
S08-C03-R08_014626-015432	There is no specific plan for the weekend, it depends on the plan I put a couple of days earlier, but I don't like staying at home.
S08-C03-R08_016491-017035	For me I like electronic gaming.
S08-C03-R08_017035-017477	I play online games and I watch .. them.
S08-C03-R08_017477-017892	I like watching football, but not so much, and I really like playing football.
S08-C03-R08_017892-018324	I mean I used to play football a lot when I was young but when I joined the faculty I stopped doing that.
S08-C03-R08_018324-018590	[HES] that's it
S08-C03-R08_019017-019059	Of course.
S08-C03-R08_019889-020575	I listen to English songs but that is in case I'm the one who puts on the music, if it's someone else okay I don't mind, but that is not the best option for me.
S08-C03-R08_020575-021790	My favorite singer, is a hard question [LAUGHTER] [HES] . I like listening to Alan Walker music so much.
S08-C03-R08_022931-023365	The movie I used to like the most was Avengers Infinity War.
S08-C03-R08_023365-023737	And the movie I will like the most will be Avengers Endgame.
S08-C03-R08_023828-024338	I like super hero movies, series, comics.
S08-C03-R08_024338-024792	The latest movie I have watched was Captain Marvels also because of super heroes.
S08-C03-R08_024946-026339	I believe that super heroes %bey %bey ((take us out of)) the reality we live in, everything is out of the box, so I like that very much.
S08-C03-R08_028236-028781	[LAUGHTER] May I not answer? [LAUGHTER] Yes.
S08-C03-R08_028781-029799	Look, for me, the idea of having children is not on my mind, %Ha .. literally [LAUGHTER], because, I mean, I will start thinking of it when I'm done establishing my my future [LAUGHTER] .
S08-C03-R08_029908-030511	I don't mind to enroll them in an international or national school, for me, I will see which one is better at that time.
S08-C03-R08_030511-031266	I believe that language will make no difference because it depends on where they will live or what they will learn I mean that will determine the language.
S08-C03-R08_032468-033955	[HES] my dream job is to be a Software Engineer, I design algorithms and software not web developer and software ..
S08-C03-R08_034228-035204	Software developers who mainly have task routine, and repeats his work every time but with different clients, different projects.
S08-C03-R08_035204-035356	I don't like that at all.
S08-C03-R08_036044-036105	Yes.
S08-C03-R08_036664-037002	I worked I did an internship last summer.
S08-C03-R08_037002-037999	[HES] It was in a company developing HR software for other companies, it was mainly software.
S08-C03-R08_037999-038322	I did an internship there for a month.
S08-C03-R08_038322-038636	The issue was very much of a routine.
S08-C03-R08_038636-039160	[HES] I have definitely learned new things but the it was pretty much routine.
S08-C03-R08_039160-039943	What I have learned in the first week I kept repeating for the following three weeks which really annoyed me.
S08-C03-R08_041368-043579	For me, I believe that working life is much better because there is more freedom than being a student, but still being a student is better in other ways that is I have a three month summer vacation in which I can do whatever I want, if I don't study I won't get fired or ((I won't run out of money)), but I believe working life has more freedom.
S08-C03-R08_044097-044181	Yes
S08-C03-R08_045278-046074	I went to Turkey, I stayed there for almost three weeks
S08-C03-R08_046074-047357	The thing I liked the most was I don't precisely remember the name of the places there, because that was a long time ago.
S08-C03-R08_047357-048986	One time we rode a chairlift on a mountain and it was .. the view was very nice and there were also some nice landscapes there as well, that's it.
S08-C03-R08_049756-049913	No I didn't make friends.
S08-C03-R08_050369-050643	I wish to tour Europe.
S08-C03-R08_050643-051285	I want to go to Italy, Spain, London, Paris.
S08-C03-R08_052238-052596	America doesn't have .. what's it called ..
S08-C03-R08_052704-052793	Not sightseeing.
S08-C03-R08_052793-053636	The .. the .. beauty of the .. the old engineering, that is architectural stuff.
S08-C03-R08_053636-053849	Such an option is not available in America at all.
S08-C03-R08_053849-054323	Europe is .. well-known for having a deep historical foundation.
S08-C03-R08_054323-054946	[HES] I want to go to Italy for instance to see the Vatican.
S08-C03-R08_054946-055228	To go to Rome.
S08-C03-R08_055228-056151	To go [HES] I mean mainly to see all the .. the art stuff there that was created, the drawings and so on.
S08-C03-R08_056151-057111	[HES] I want to go to London for example to see old houses and streets they still preserve the .. the old design of London.
S08-C03-R08_057111-058343	Same applies to Spain, [HES] but I mean mainly because I want to watch old things and see new natural scenery, I mean not to watch modern things.
S08-C03-R08_059631-059767	No, I will definitely travel.
S08-C03-R08_059881-060758	Because I don't want to stay here [LAUGHTER] and of course I want to go there so I mean both factors totally support the idea.
S08-C03-R08_062441-062836	The trip I liked the most was when I went to Dahab.
S08-C03-R08_062836-064227	[HES] I went there to the .. the place I mean it's mainly about the sea and coral reefs and diving and snorkeling so ((so it's really nice)) .
S08-C03-R08_064227-065240	[HES] you disconnect from the internet and so, so you live the moment and you see things for the first time.
S08-C03-R08_065577-065748	Not at all I don't like it.
S08-C03-R08_066063-066954	I have read a book before and I read a lot of papers in English currently because of my bachelor but I only read when I'm forced to read.
S08-C03-R08_069590-069815	I think when I joined CS.
S08-C03-R08_070381-071259	No it didn't change anything in my personality but it's because if I would've joined the other major at the university, which was mechatronic, I would have failed and I would have been an unsuccessful person.
S08-C03-R08_072182-072623	I like to work with a team that I know and I have worked with before, I mean, I have experienced how they get the work done.
S08-C03-R08_072623-073636	If I don't know the team I prefer to be individual because team work I mean working in a team it causes a lot of problems.
S08-C03-R08_076241-077888	I don't have a specific role model but I want to be a successful person and I don't want to have a life of routine and I want to achieve many things but to have one role model %b .. I mean a specific one no, but there are many role models.
S08-C03-R08_079173-079277	Respected.
S08-C03-R08_080366-082469	It is not possible that you %t .. respect or respect someone without liking him [HES] even if you don't like him but at least you won't hate him and if someone works with me or if I work with someone that I like and don't respect then I might not be doing my work well or I might be doing my work in a careless way I mean.
S08-C03-R08_084092-086415	[HES] most of the people who talked to me or I got to know we didn't talk much at the beginning because for me I don't like getting familiar with someone easily because the other person doesn't know how to deal with me or I don't know how to deal .. deal with him so such an issue sets borders between us.
S08-C03-R08_087378-088082	The trait I like the most in me [HES] is that I overthink but sometimes some people don't like that.
S08-C03-R08_089519-090287	No for me there is no specific trait but as long as he ((doesn't treat me unfair)) he doesn't annoy me then I have no problem with him.
S08-C03-R08_092093-093464	No for me I find no difficulty but it's %s .. sometimes I change my way of talking or the .. not exactly my way of talking but the way I explain things or express myself so as to easily deliver it without explaining too much.
S08-C03-R08_095685-097012	No I didn't mention big expressions but I was trying to clarify the point that he wants to reach but I don't understand it I mean he wants to hear this sentence or this point so I make him listen to it.
S08-C03-R08_097889-098359	No, I mean, till now, no one has ((found that out)) and he kept asking me to know whether I understand or not.
S08-C03-R08_098656-098931	Yes I can live without a mobile.
S08-C03-R08_099654-099860	For me the laptop is much more important than the mobile.
S08-C03-R08_099860-100312	[HES] I don't care much about talking to people.
S08-C03-R08_100312-100547	I don't like phone calls at all.
S08-C03-R08_100547-100987	I don't like chatting much but I mean it's better than phone call.
S08-C03-R08_100987-101326	I can chat on the mobile or laptop.
S08-C03-R08_101326-101720	[HES] for me normally I don't spend much time on the mobile in the first place.
S08-C03-R08_103535-103646	So why don't you let me think?
S08-C03-R08_104957-105079	Let me think.
S08-C03-R08_105755-106337	I can convince you now that your project is useless
S08-C03-R08_106511-106855	I mean what .. what is your expectation for the project?
S08-C03-R08_106855-107145	I mean when you finalize it, what will happen then?
S08-C03-R08_108102-108752	I have read its description when it was published to choose the project so mainly I have a general idea about it.
S08-C03-R08_109462-110021	Okay at least tell me, what do you think this project will achieve or what will you do with it after it's done?
S08-C03-R08_112662-112853	But still, what benefit did you get out of it I mean?
S08-C03-R08_113053-113175	What's the benefit?
S08-C03-R08_113175-114045	You benefited .. I mean right now I .. right now you made a personality test for someone and you know my personality, are you suppose to make a personality test for everyone you meet.
S08-C03-R08_115623-117169	Unless .. for me I will not make a personality test for everyone I meet or deal with, so this issue comes by experience in dealing, I don't have time to make personality test for everyone, so for me this issue is not ..
S08-C03-R08_122575-123563	I got convinced by the part of .. that it %y .. application and %y .. %y convert the text, regarding the personality it could be.
S08-C03-R08_123793-123879	You're welcome.
S15-C03-R15_001897-002793	Well I was born in Egypt in Cairo and I was .. I don't know whether this is considered national or international, but I was in a French school.
S15-C03-R15_002793-003840	Back in the old days in our days there was no .. I'm not very old [LAUGHTER] there was no national and international and ((such issues)) but I was in a French school.
S15-C03-R15_003840-004345	And then after I graduated I joined the GUC.
S15-C03-R15_004345-005423	At first I didn't want .. I mean to be .. I wanted to stop studying in general after school and to ((pursue an easy career)), but then my score allowed me to join Engineering so I prayed and I joined it.
S15-C03-R15_005423-006069	My options were either to enroll in Ain Shams Engineering or in any other university, private I mean.
S15-C03-R15_006069-006315	I joined Engineering Ain shams.
S15-C03-R15_006315-006832	Honestly two days there [LAUGHTER] were more than enough to decide never to go there again.
S15-C03-R15_006832-007787	That's it, and after my university I had the option to make the bachelor abroad, so I did that.
S15-C03-R15_007787-009044	I joined a university in Germany .. in .. in .. in a place that is a ((small town)) in Germany probably, it had only one street, a university and one supermarket and one pharmacy and that's it [LAUGHTER] .
S15-C03-R15_009044-009538	Yes and there was a train station far away from home, and that's it.
S15-C03-R15_009538-011513	Then I returned back to my university, I completed my last year, then I traveled to Austria I did my Master's I stayed for a year, the group was very nice because there were some people from my university with me in the Master's so it was very nice, I mean it was a nice year, a nice experience.
S15-C03-R15_011513-012768	The most experience I got is that .. how to deal with people in a different way than in Egypt, it's not only a scientific experience but rather how to be independent not depending on spoon feeding.
S15-C03-R15_012954-013595	So personality wise, it was really nice, and scientific wise and everything.
S15-C03-R15_013595-014263	And then I returned back to my university, I worked there for one semester.
S15-C03-R15_014263-015614	Then I find my doctor coming in to my office, I mean one of the doctors and she is accompanying another senior German professor, ((senior)) I mean, with a hair style and white hair and ((it was state)) I mean and he told me I came to watch you.
S15-C03-R15_015614-016988	So I looked at him, he told me I'm the doctor who works with her who .. who .. who the doctor he pointed at .. who was accompanying him I mean she told me you're very clever and .. and you can make a good PhD and I have a topic that you will like and you will travel to Germany.
S15-C03-R15_016988-017430	I told him in the name of God if you were .. if it was .. if you believe so, okay
S15-C03-R15_017430-017955	So I saw the topic, it was really nice and what was better than the topic was to travel to Germany, it was even nicer and nicer.
S15-C03-R15_017955-018392	So I accepted the topic, and I traveled to Germany.
S15-C03-R15_018476-018910	[HES] The department was very nice, and the professor was very nice.
S15-C03-R15_018910-019268	They were nice because they wanted me to be integrated in the German culture.
S15-C03-R15_019268-019880	They they were keen in making me speak German all time and they were always talking to me in German, I mean when I talk in English they don't reply back and so.
S15-C03-R15_019880-020068	So they they were really nice.
S15-C03-R15_020324-020823	And really we were friends, as in we visited each other in the weekends and so.
S15-C03-R15_020823-021457	So .. and the department was nice and I am still friends with many of them till now.
S15-C03-R15_021457-022569	So I stayed in Germany, I mean I used to come, I mainly stayed for four years, but I was on and off, I mean I come in Christmas for two months .. one month, I come in summer vacation for three months, ((I was kind of joking)) I mean.
S15-C03-R15_022569-022852	It was really nice, I learned a lot.
S15-C03-R15_022852-023967	And afterwards, the professor retired and the department got separated and I had to go back to Egypt [LAUGHTER], then I got married.
S15-C03-R15_023967-025197	But still the PhD is not done yet because the professor is very unresponsive now since he retired, so he is either in Italy, or in Greece, or in Vietnam, so when he is in Germany sometimes he answers me back, sometimes that's it.
S15-C03-R15_025197-026440	That's it so I have finished my PhD two years ago, thank God, and ((I'm still waiting to finalize)) [LAUGHTER] and that's it about me, I mean.
S15-C03-R15_026973-027166	You are having exams right?
S15-C03-R15_027166-027304	Okay okay [LAUGHTER] .
S15-C03-R15_027304-028142	I will resign from my job after .. I have mentioned the name of the institution .. I will resigned from my job after three weeks.
S15-C03-R15_028142-028241	And they are causing me trouble.
S15-C03-R15_028241-028576	And I will immigrate to Australia, that's it.
S15-C03-R15_029232-031397	Okay, I wake up in the morning, then I wash up and ((get prepared)) and then the first thing I do then I eat breakfast because if I don't eat I might eat someone so I eat breakfast and before it I have coffee, the most important thing is coffee with breakfast, and then I get dressed in a very long time, one hour.
S15-C03-R15_031397-033680	And then, then I have a daughter, so most probably she is awake by then, so most probably she wants to play immediately, so most probably I try to convince her that we can't play because I have to work, so I leave her with her pappy to get her dressed and take her to the nursery, ((and I leave them, to do what they want)) and then I go to work.
S15-C03-R15_033680-034158	Hopefully I'm at the university around seven thirty, something like that.
S15-C03-R15_034220-034492	I mean given that I wake up at five.
S15-C03-R15_034933-035817	Specific plans [LAUGHTER], given that I'm a parent?
S15-C03-R15_035817-036576	Yes plans that we go any place where there are games, interesting things, of course I enjoy it all.
S15-C03-R15_036576-036900	Hobbies? Yes, I read, I used to read actually.
S15-C03-R15_036900-038839	And I listen to music and song, and I like to collect oldies, French oldies, and Italians oldies and all these things so that's what I do basically in the .. if I have no work in the weekend, and working on a paper, I mean, and this is something very uncommon that the weekend is not loaded and that I do not have to come to work and the university in the weekend I mean so I do such things, yes.
S15-C03-R15_039848-040034	Favorite quote is in French.
S15-C03-R15_040034-040227	I don't know whether I can share it with you or not?
S15-C03-R15_040319-041062	French.
S15-C03-R15_041257-041847	It says nothing is right or wrong it's all about thoughts and lies,
S15-C03-R15_041847-042157	French.
S15-C03-R15_042157-043155	Yes that it's all mainly illusions of the heart the .. the .. the .. the spirit is what is %pw responsible to propagate it.
S15-C03-R15_043155-044364	It means that there is nothing ultimately right, and there is nothing ultimately wrong, mainly everything is [HES] relative to the society you are living in.
S15-C03-R15_045572-046363	I will answer .. your question based on if I were in Egypt, because we decided to leave Egypt very recently so we we had plans.
S15-C03-R15_047392-048816	And given that you you categorize a school as a national, I don't want her to .. to receive the same education I have received, despite the fact that it was the best at that time, but I grew up lacking many things.
S15-C03-R15_048816-049093	Lacking of experience, we were very naive.
S15-C03-R15_049093-050029	Lacking of hobbies and .. and .. and I mean presentation skills and such things and self confidence and ((all these things)) .
S15-C03-R15_050029-050804	That was from the school that was very strict, that was mainly .. mainly religious I mean and ((all these things)) .
S15-C03-R15_050804-052021	So no, I want her to have a stronger personality, a broader horizon, and to have the time to practice her hobbies and to excel in it.
S15-C03-R15_052021-053180	And that even helps people to be creative at work, not to have specific books that she is bound by, that she is limited by I mean.
S15-C03-R15_053180-053460	So I was going to enroll her in French.
S15-C03-R15_054417-056610	No, I would still work in the academic career because it is my favorite career and I never .. I mean despite the fact that it is financially not rewarding, especially in Egypt, but no, it .. it worth it .. because you have the opportunity to do what you like, and to be creative, to be the first one who does something, because in research you you create stuff.
S15-C03-R15_056610-058799	So you have the .. the .. the .. the privilege that you to have the .. the .. I mean the .. to .. to own an idea and you to .. to be .. to .. to unleash your curiosity, that you learn to .. to .. to search for things you're interested in you're curious to know more about it.
S15-C03-R15_058799-059015	So that's the best.
S15-C03-R15_059015-059538	And that it isn't .. isn't based on routine, I mean not everyday you go to work, sit on your desk, no not at all, on the contrary.
S15-C03-R15_059538-061666	Most campuses have gardens and have open areas, plus if you there's also teaching, so you deal with different persons and you deal with students and you remain .. you remain always young because you always deal with youth, so it's interesting
S15-C03-R15_061666-062686	Well, do you like working life more or do you miss the time when you were a student? %k .. I mean less responsibilities for instance? Which do you think is better and why?
S15-C03-R15_062686-063047	Definitely student and I don't think anyone answered you otherwise I mean.
S15-C03-R15_063123-064931	Yes no of course because in the students life you you have at least that is the main privilege that you have three months that they they .. they are your own you %bet .. %bet .. manage them freely, as you wish, you have time to do activities in.
S15-C03-R15_064931-065604	I mean, one time in a summer vacation, I decided to take Italian lessons, so ((I achieved something)) at the end.
S15-C03-R15_065604-066033	But yes, I mean, it's a plus that you have nothing to do.
S15-C03-R15_066033-066354	Of course the academic life in Egypt is different.
S15-C03-R15_066354-066929	It's supposed to be that normally you are free in the evenings and you are free in the weekends.
S15-C03-R15_066929-067221	Here in Egypt we used to wait for the weekend to work.
S15-C03-R15_067221-067461	But definitely the academic life is better.
S15-C03-R15_068531-069484	Career-wise no? because I, career-wise, as I have told you, ((it was predestined rather than freedom of will)), I got the PhD, I got the Master's.
S15-C03-R15_069484-069884	And in general, every decision I take, doesn't happen, always.
S15-C03-R15_069884-071166	I mean for example I decided that I will not take the academic career because my mother is a professor and I see her always working and she works at home and research and papers and so on and I said that I don't want my life to be like that, I will work in nothing.
S15-C03-R15_071166-071283	I will be a make up artist.
S15-C03-R15_071283-071407	Or something of that sort.
S15-C03-R15_071407-071702	And I won't spend my life in the .. in education.
S15-C03-R15_071702-072238	As you see can of course [LAUGHTER], I didn't spend my life in education, I mean.
S15-C03-R15_072238-073237	So no, I didn't have weird turning points, apart from personal life decisions of course, like getting married and all these things.
S15-C03-R15_073237-073565	But my life has been smooth, thank God.
S15-C03-R15_074420-076387	No, honestly, despite that it's not common, and it's not what people like saying, but no I don't like working in groups at all, at all, because I don't like my work to be depending on someone who doesn't work properly, so is unpunctual, so ((we will disagree)) .
S15-C03-R15_076387-076602	So, no, I like to work alone.
S15-C03-R15_076602-077311	And I can't work in noise, because I get distracted easily, so I like to focus, even I'm always not in my office, just like you didn't find me.
S15-C03-R15_077311-077900	So when I want to work %b .. %b .. I search for an empty class or an empty room that must be sunny and I work there.
S15-C03-R15_077900-079942	So no I can't work in groups except rarely and the groups have to be under my control, I mean students, so I would know who is working and who isn't .. isn't working and doesn't .. I mean I can control who does not work, but peers who I mean especially in our community, it's very hard for me.
S15-C03-R15_080800-081471	An ultimate role model, no I don't have, but in everything specific thing, there is someone to be like.
S15-C03-R15_081471-081956	For instance .. for instance on the personal level, there is someone who I would like to be like.
S15-C03-R15_081956-082563	On the professional level, yes, there is someone in the university that we all know [LAUGHTER] .
S15-C03-R15_083481-083817	No, it's not easy for someone to break the ice with me unfortunately.
S15-C03-R15_083817-085417	I mean that .. not for any reason but because I'm a bit shy so .. and I .. I worry, a bit conservative so I don't .. I don't get along with people quickly, I mean it's not easy that I break the boundaries, so it's not easy for me to get along at start and I was told that by several people.
S15-C03-R15_086132-086426	Liked or respected?
S15-C03-R15_086426-087323	But I think both of them are interleaving, I mean you cannot like someone and disrespect him or what do you think?
S15-C03-R15_087323-087429	And you cannot respect.
S15-C03-R15_089721-089882	Yes the liked person must be ..
S15-C03-R15_089882-090013	No well it depends as well.
S15-C03-R15_090144-091381	Depends on the domains, I mean for example on a personal level no I would rather be liked because things are cute and nice and .. but I I would rather be respected than liked in general, I mean in general I mean yes [LAUGHTER] .
S15-C03-R15_092065-092152	Definitely yes.
S15-C03-R15_092152-092360	I mean yes, very, very, very much.
S15-C03-R15_092360-093268	It's I mean for example people who are mainly from .. from international school, bubble English, who talk in English a lot.
S15-C03-R15_093268-094398	By time, not for a specific reason, there is no common topic to discuss I mean, so ((what's the problem?)) I mean they are in [HES] a different world.
S15-C03-R15_094398-095239	And of course different people for example I mean when I go fix my car at the automotive technician we don't really love each other, and so on.
S15-C03-R15_096133-096824	La la land is beautiful [LAUGHTER] .
S15-C03-R15_096824-097812	Yes that I can isolate myself from what's going on and to be in .. so this is a good thing as it allows one to not get very stressed and to escape a current situation, I mean.
S15-C03-R15_099346-099728	I want to clarify that if there is something that I don't understand, I will not talk in English.
S15-C03-R15_099838-100326	Not at all I mean, because .. I mean, ((never mind)), thank God for everything.
S15-C03-R15_100326-101095	So no when I don't understand something I would rather stay silent honestly so as not to be exposed.
S15-C03-R15_101448-102323	[HES] Yes I can live without a mobile and I like to turn it off for many hours and ignore it as if I'm not there, yes.
S15-C03-R15_102903-104109	As we used to communicate before the mobile to be created, I mean the telephone, either I tell people where I am and if I don't want to be reached, then I will not tell people and I will not be reached I mean.
S15-C03-R15_105142-106370	[HUM] anything that I can convince you with, then I will convince you that you have to go shopping very frequently because it's a very interesting thing.
S15-C03-R15_106370-106517	Why so?
S15-C03-R15_106517-106632	Because of many things.
S15-C03-R15_106632-109062	Despite the fact that it is financially very harmful [LAUGHTER] but I think that .. that you see new things and see yourself I mean in a very good shape, it's .. or I mean in .. in .. in .. in a .. in a good form, initially not in a good shape relieves stress and makes you have .. have more self-confidence .
S15-C03-R15_109062-109479	And [HES] what else?
S15-C03-R15_109479-110271	It's enough the process of going around, seeing new stuff like that, it's very interesting.
S15-C03-R15_110271-110442	I'm not convinced, no problem.
S15-C03-R15_110799-110896	You're welcome .. are we done?
S18-C03-R18_001035-001171	Where am I from? I'm from Cairo.
S18-C03-R18_001171-001618	[HES] It is secondary school .. the first private school.
S18-C03-R18_001618-002588	The university I was in, without mentioning names, I was in the IT department, major DS, minor CS what else?
S18-C03-R18_003242-003357	Private schools.
S18-C03-R18_004025-004230	No standard Arabic school.
S18-C03-R18_005363-005662	((why don't you start)) your master degree as well to ..
S18-C03-R18_005805-006596	My graduation project was in IT we were mainly interested in pattern recognition machine learning the AI.
S18-C03-R18_006596-007263	[HES] my bachelor was about, if I remember correctly, traffic monitoring.
S18-C03-R18_007263-008083	We were working in traffic monitoring on video processing so we were .. were trying to detect the traffic for example within a certain period.
S18-C03-R18_008083-009550	[HES] we were also able to, with the program we developed, to track any car and see how long it takes for it to get out of my image or the picture .. my video, the exact same car.
S18-C03-R18_009550-011255	Of course regardless of the obstacles that there were different regions we were intending to continue afterwards the information the same as Wasalney service and such services which is to send a notification on the system that there are alternatives you can %t .. I mean avoid this route .. so you can take another route.
S18-C03-R18_011255-011557	That's in the bachelor.
S18-C03-R18_011624-012393	And in the masters I was mainly interested or my .. my topic was computer diagnosing system for medical imaging.
S18-C03-R18_012481-013277	That was mainly focus on the medical imaging, I worked on liver cancer and breast cancer and leukemia.
S18-C03-R18_013277-013474	In liver cancer, I worked on CT images.
S18-C03-R18_014268-014515	And what else did you work on?
S18-C03-R18_014515-015953	And I worked on leukemia on something that I don't remember what it's called, but it was slide images, the images I was working on was Qasr el .. no not Medicine Qasr El Einy, it was Veterinary Medicine, Veterinary Medicine,
S18-C03-R18_015953-016226	[HES] what else?
S18-C03-R18_016226-016435	And I worked a bit on Alzheimer disease.
S18-C03-R18_016435-017947	We were detecting Alzheimer from images, which was normally being done by survey, and they were questions like that do you remember or don't you remember we did [HES] the program was detecting the image in the form of the .. the of the MRI image so we were trying to detect the Alzheimer.
S18-C03-R18_017947-018048	What else?
S18-C03-R18_018048-018732	I'm suppose to have publications, I have 29 publication papers till now.
S18-C03-R18_018732-019755	My i-index is eight and the h-index is eight, so I have good citations plus the codes that I developed are original, it was uploaded on MATLAB.
S18-C03-R18_020885-021237	Okay [HES] my day starts very early.
S18-C03-R18_021384-021601	I go to sleep early so I wake up early.
S18-C03-R18_021601-022012	[HES] what are the activities that I do meaning from the very beginning?
S18-C03-R18_022012-023420	Briefly, okay, I pray and have breakfast and afterwards I come here to the GUC, I have a task and I have tutorials, I have labs, I finish, in case I have preparation to do I can normally continue working at home and when I'm done I go to sleep .
S18-C03-R18_024179-024651	This issue is hard for me, because ((I involved myself)) in more than one thing.
S18-C03-R18_024651-025168	I mean I was supposed to be working .. I ((got assigned)) as a top graduate.
S18-C03-R18_025349-025476	Okay.
S18-C03-R18_025476-025889	So I worked in a place, I stayed a long time in that place.
S18-C03-R18_026054-026523	I can go there after some time, to that place or I can continue my PhD degree.
S18-C03-R18_026580-027166	I also have a meeting with my doctor the supervisor, so .. so the time .. I have a lot of time I mean.
S18-C03-R18_027465-027614	[HUM] no.
S18-C03-R18_027759-028070	Still no, I like to search more than read.
S18-C03-R18_029795-030866	The movies that I like are either horror movies or cartoon movies [LAUGHTER], in the case of cartoon movies I can watch anything, but for the horror movies, I usually watch Turkish movies.
S18-C03-R18_031000-031306	The most horror movies are truly effective.
S18-C03-R18_032509-033745	It narrates that they .. I mean such things like devils and ((ghosts)) and similar things, but the point is in that the sound effects and the visual effects are very nice [LAUGHTER] .
S18-C03-R18_034318-034436	No.
S18-C03-R18_035711-036077	Mainly it will be English, that is the most common language.
S18-C03-R18_036979-037394	It depends also you cannot add .. I mean have an opinion right now about everything.
S18-C03-R18_037394-037690	That depends on several things, many factors.
S18-C03-R18_037938-038312	A far away school, a nearby school, there are also many other factors.
S18-C03-R18_039244-039411	I worked on many things.
S18-C03-R18_039627-039884	Because I graduated almost 6 years ago.
S18-C03-R18_039884-040474	I worked for two or three years in development, it was software development.
S18-C03-R18_040728-041499	After that I left it and then I worked in big data and data analytics so it was mainly AI and machine learning.
S18-C03-R18_041499-041987	We used to make implementation for any papers that we have read and develop a product that we finally show to the clients.
S18-C03-R18_041987-042636	I stayed with them for a very long time, and then I worked in another field, it was technical support in the other place.
S18-C03-R18_042636-043605	And afterwards after I finished the Masters and I finished the pre-PhD, I applied here as a teaching .. or not as teaching .. lecturer assistant.
S18-C03-R18_044330-044421	[HUM] No.
S18-C03-R18_045732-045902	There aren't many responsibilities.
S18-C03-R18_045902-047707	I mean now I have .. my time .. I have a lot on my mind, my work, my study [LAUGHTER] and also my work in more than one place and projects with other people and I'm also working in scientific research .. I mean scientific research group, so the issue now is that I always have no time [LAUGHTER] .
S18-C03-R18_048068-048191	[HES] No.
S18-C03-R18_049515-049760	Places you have visited.
S18-C03-R18_049760-050694	Well [HES] can I tell you about ((summer vacations)) well because this might me the thing I remember the most, I don't remember places.
S18-C03-R18_050694-050962	I don't even remember you [LAUGHTER] .
S18-C03-R18_051189-051400	I always love the sea.
S18-C03-R18_051400-052752	So any place nearby the sea I would be mainly interested in, regardless whether I can I mean swim or not but the idea of seeing something moving and the everything is smoothly, ((it's a whole other universe)) .
S18-C03-R18_054935-055812	In general even after you graduate, every year .. not every year, every six months you will find that your way of thinking changes.
S18-C03-R18_055812-056394	I mean for example you will find that, after a while, your opinion regarding something wasn't correct.
S18-C03-R18_056394-057075	You will find that there are other factors that get introduced so you you no longer see the superficial view that you used to see but rather look ahead.
S18-C03-R18_057075-057778	I mean when I was a student I used to ((look under my feet)), what am I going to do now and that's it. But afterwards, no, I think of what might happen in the future.
S18-C03-R18_058751-059117	It depend on the team I will be working with.
S18-C03-R18_059117-060083	I mean if we all have the same level of qualification, it's okay, but if each one of us in the team might not be effective, for me it would be a high load.
S18-C03-R18_061823-062595	Okay every .. I might have many people that I like, but each one of them is specialized in a certain part.
S18-C03-R18_062595-063787	I mean for instance I .. for instance I like someone in research, I won't mention his name because he achieved a very good point and received many awards, so I like this part in him, but that doesn't mean that I like other things.
S18-C03-R18_063787-064681	Your father for instance, you will also find that I like everything about him, except for nervousness, no I don't want such nervousness, so you like certain traits in every person that you like.
S18-C03-R18_065671-065764	Respected.
S18-C03-R18_065945-066594	Okay [HES] I believe that respect is more important than everything else.
S18-C03-R18_066594-067966	When you deal with the other person as a respected person, you will be able to accept anything from him, but if someone loves you, in the end he might for instance act in a way that his behavior and his attitude isn't good, so he will annoy you in the end.
S18-C03-R18_069491-069616	No [LAUGHTER] .
S18-C03-R18_069831-070742	[HES] I have moved to Cairo for college
S18-C03-R18_071902-072248	Here after the SE [LAUGHTER] .
S18-C03-R18_072248-073489	Yes I saw people I mean [LAUGHTER] I need to change .. so I do adaption, but not adaption in a way that is .. that is very high, no, adaption that is on a low level, but I am able to adapt in the end.
S18-C03-R18_074513-074824	[HUM] I persist in what I want, perseverance.
S18-C03-R18_075306-075650	It is such perseverance that will make you achieve any goal you want in your life.
S18-C03-R18_076488-076868	Okay [LAUGHTER] I shall speak freely then [LAUGHTER] .
S18-C03-R18_076868-077127	Arrogance, I don't like arrogant people.
S18-C03-R18_077127-078029	He might be arrogant but he doesn't show that, or he thinks highly of himself but he is not modest, he feels that he is always better than others, proud, I can never deal with such a person.
S18-C03-R18_079116-079874	A lot of things worry me, but [LAUGHTER] what is the thing that worries me the most?
S18-C03-R18_079874-081195	[HUM] It could be that when I enter a new place, for me this also worries me, that I don't know the place or I don't know the people, so at first it is difficult for me.
S18-C03-R18_081195-081447	This could be the thing that worries me the most at that time I mean.
S18-C03-R18_081775-082105	[HES] how can you overcome that?
S18-C03-R18_082105-083121	Okay .. I try to talk to someone and then you initially .. once you start talking to people, that's it, the fear of the place or the fear of people goes away.
S18-C03-R18_085027-085399	Okay it never happened to me because I always have a plan for everything.
S18-C03-R18_085399-085867	I mean I can't .. I mean as I have told you before, I don't have .. everything for me is organized.
S18-C03-R18_085867-086378	I know what I'm going to do tomorrow and I know what I'm going to say so I have everything prepared and I'm ready with everything.
S18-C03-R18_086378-087911	If there was something that I couldn't .. I mean, it is possible that someone might ask me a question, no, this is ((attitude)), I mean, personally, for example, no, I can ask him to skip this question and wait for the next tutorial or the next lab and then I will give you an answer, but to give him an incorrect answer, that is ((far fetched)) .
S18-C03-R18_088893-089108	[LAUGHTER] You mean it.
S18-C03-R18_089108-089788	In the evaluation it is not .. I know in the evaluation, not everyone has ((worked equally)), but at least, they should understand.
S18-C03-R18_089788-090458	I'm not asking whether you know that or not, no, I'm asking if you understand the concept, not understand just .. I mean, just syntax and that's it.
S18-C03-R18_091050-091423	Without a mobile? You mean without social media in general? Without net.
S18-C03-R18_091462-091618	Without net this is hard.
S18-C03-R18_091678-092140	Without mobile, ((that's okay)), I can throw it anywhere, and use external applications, so it's not the mobile but rather the net, right?
S18-C03-R18_092197-092324	So network is hard.
S18-C03-R18_092740-092881	No I'm not .. ((I wasn't living in the old days)) .
S18-C03-R18_093307-093465	But because ((things)) were different.
S18-C03-R18_093465-093838	They had libraries there and the libraries provided them with everything.
S18-C03-R18_093838-094524	Plus they used to see their father and mother sitting together, now, we don't see our father and mother often, each one of us is living in a diffferent universe.
S18-C03-R18_094568-095348	So now it's nice, as ((it speeds ups things)) but of course, our communications has become it was greatly reduced.
S18-C03-R18_097068-097291	To convince you of something [LAUGHTER] .
S18-C03-R18_097291-097754	I would convince you to change what you are doing and to work in AI or machine learning.
S18-C03-R18_097754-098299	NLP is fine but has many problems.
S18-C03-R18_098299-100084	I mean, for example, if you apply NLP or processing on Arabic language, it will be very hard, because English is just one definite language, you write using the same script, but in the case of Arabic, every one has his own dialect, you cannot figure out what he's saying.
S18-C03-R18_100084-100286	Sometimes you don't understand Gulf Arabic dialects for instance.
S18-C03-R18_100286-100801	They keep talking to each other, I'm decode their speech, is he really speaking Arabic or I'm just imagining that!
S18-C03-R18_100801-100911	So it's a difficult issue.
S18-C03-R18_101056-101312	I'm convinced [LAUGHTER] .
S19-C03-R19_001628-002048	Okay I was born in .. in Tanta and my school was also in Tanta.
S19-C03-R19_002048-002719	My first language was standard Arabic and we used to learn English and we used to learn French as well.
S19-C03-R19_002719-003125	[HES] I moved to Cairo for college.
S19-C03-R19_003125-003681	[HES] I studied English and Deutsch at college, that's it.
S19-C03-R19_004356-005229	Okay I'm in the faculty of Engineering, my major is computer science, we chose this major in .. in second year.
S19-C03-R19_005229-005753	[HES] we study .. we do programming and coding, games and all these things.
S19-C03-R19_007114-008265	I didn't even know that the field of computer science existed at the university but some of my friends joined the university and told me about this field and they told me that it's good at the university I mean.
S19-C03-R19_008265-009602	So when I joined university, I tried ((looking into what's there)) and .. and to know what they study and what fields are related to it and so on and .. and I found the topic interesting and new and taught well at the university so that's why I had chosen it actually.
S19-C03-R19_010509-011499	Okay my bachelor project was a game, this game follows a concept of something called hour of code which was extensively done before.
S19-C03-R19_011499-012447	That you teach children of .. of .. of different ages programming skills through .. through games, only.
S19-C03-R19_012447-013041	I'm supposed to develop a similar game but I'm supposed to teach children Arduino in it.
S19-C03-R19_013041-014826	They have a board that's like a simulator and they should make the connections and write the code below a specific scene in each level for instance and then the target is that they learn these connections correctly and how to write the coding correctly so that they pass each level until they have known all the .. the concepts.
S19-C03-R19_015646-016811	My daily routine is that I wake up normally, I have to spend two hours on my mobile first and then I have breakfast and drink Nescafe and start working, although I'm a bit late, but I can stay up late to work actually.
S19-C03-R19_016811-018475	I have to take several breaks, sometimes I spend my breaks drawing, sometimes napping, sometimes I go out for a while, I have to be listening to music all day of course, as I can't study without music, but I think there's nothing extra than that I mean.
S19-C03-R19_019348-019940	Okay it's mostly English, it's usually pop or hip pop.
S19-C03-R19_019940-020557	I mean such as Imagine Dragons, as [HES] .. as Justin Bieber.
S19-C03-R19_020902-021260	And all of these are Rap singers, this is the category that I like listening to actually.
S19-C03-R19_021445-021822	Not really, but I prefer writing.
S19-C03-R19_022394-023303	It's not .. not a specific category but I mean in general when I have any negative energy for instance or anything, I like to get rid of the negative energy through writing.
S19-C03-R19_023303-024787	I write more about social topics actually, I don't write stories or so, no I mean for example, I write about general problems that people face so .. so .. actually some people like what I write because they ((relate to it)), that's the point.
S19-C03-R19_025762-026848	Okay I love music in general, actually I have made sound tracks several times before, it's mainly like mixing of a lot of things, that's to say.
S19-C03-R19_026848-027244	[HES] I like drawing very much, there's an art called Mandelas, I like to draw it.
S19-C03-R19_027244-028393	[HES] I like painting actually .. and when anyone wants to draw something in large areas for %b .. they tell me actually, sometimes I help them or so.
S19-C03-R19_028393-028876	Mostly it's more of geometrical drawings I mean, as I like to draw using a pencil and ruler actually.
S19-C03-R19_028876-029151	These are all my hobbies.
S19-C03-R19_030340-031230	There isn't one in specific, but I mean generally the .. the .. the motivational quotes and so, I like reading it from time to time.
S19-C03-R19_031230-032263	Actually I did subscribe to a lot of pages %bt .. that post these kind of quotes so .. so I feel that it keeps me going actually, but there isn't one in specific I mean.
S19-C03-R19_032678-032911	[HES] Yes actually, they are mostly in English as well.
S19-C03-R19_034299-034698	I love a movie called .. called Warrior.
S19-C03-R19_034698-035983	It was I mean the story was about two brothers but they were actually .. actually their lives went in different paths but by the end they loved .. loved a sport, that is Kick Boxing.
S19-C03-R19_035983-036800	%F .. so in the end, they reached the final match together so the story became a bit dramatic at the end when they were facing one another and so on.
S19-C03-R19_038436-040677	I'm thinking actually of enrolling him in a national English school as he is [HES] mostly .. I mean the majority of faculties or centers or so require English background in applicants so it should be English and national in order not to .. not to feel a great difference honestly [LAUGHTER]
S19-C03-R19_043065-044405	I'm thinking after finishing .. after finishing my Masters as we would have have already studied part of it actually, but after the Masters, I don't know what I will .. I mean ((what I will go for)) .
S19-C03-R19_044524-046183	Actually the topic of Web Development and so, I'm thinking of taking courses in it or so, because when I attended the training somewhere the .. the .. I mean their target was that .. the trainees or most of their work was .. was in Web Development, that's why I felt that this is the most required skill in jobs or so.
S19-C03-R19_047163-048644	I have completed an internship, yes, it was a training in a place where I was asked to do a task, it was something similar to a website, I was required to create a database and front-end and so on.
S19-C03-R19_048644-049662	So I didn't complete the task because there were many concepts that I didn't know, so I wasted a lot of time trying to know these concepts.
S19-C03-R19_049662-050730	But actually .. actually what I have learned back then is that this is what was required in .. in many other places, that's why, if God wills, my target is actually to learn these things.
S19-C03-R19_052358-054359	I feel that .. that whether student life or working life, each has it's own advantages, but the .. the advantage of the working life is that ((we can organize our time as we wish)), I mean whether for traveling or at .. at work or so, that's it.
S19-C03-R19_054359-056038	Also, if God's wills, work would actually be something that one would love to do, so it will be much more exciting, unlike the university, where we can take a lot of courses that I don't like so the issue is actually not .. not nice I mean for .. for any student actually, that's all.
S19-C03-R19_056646-057022	I have traveled, but I was young, so honestly, I don't actually remember.
S19-C03-R19_057022-058245	Okay .. okay can you tell us more about a trip here in Egypt, for example, and the scene you remember the most as the most remarkable one, and that trip is unforgettable, can you tell us about the activities that you did and so on I mean?
S19-C03-R19_058333-058850	One of the best trips I went to was .. was a Nile Cruise of Luxor and Aswan.
S19-C03-R19_058850-060240	So honestly, I really loved the .. the .. the .. culture there, that they have such an immortal culture there, no matter how the .. time passes I mean, they always maintain their traditions.
S19-C03-R19_060240-062537	Moreover, the .. the .. the Pharaonic artifacts and so I mean are actually great, and we also had a good tour guide with us so .. so he ((made us love it even more I mean)), and he told us about their .. their history, so it was I actually liked it and I wanted to repeat this trip many times before, but actually I fail to do so several times due to certain circumstances or so, that's it.
S19-C03-R19_063324-064978	[HES] I actually wish to travel abroad, Paris actually in particular, I feel it's a beautiful country [HES], it's also in Europe and in Europe it's .. it's easy the .. the transfer from one country to the other and so.
S19-C03-R19_064978-065444	But actually the most place I wish to visit is Paris I mean.
S19-C03-R19_066753-068242	I will think about it a lot, I mean I will not .. will not neglect it, I will think about it a lot and I will make all the calculations well I mean and .. but if the .. ((I have the chance)), I will travel, yes, I won't .. won't hesitate in anything actually.
S19-C03-R19_070328-072157	This turning point might have been due to my educational circumstances and so that I decided that I will travel, I mean, I will no longer live in Tanta but rather live in .. in Cairo, of course, it was a new experience for me to live alone and to be responsible for my finances and life and so on.
S19-C03-R19_072157-073183	That's all, so maybe this was a turning point, it was also actually a part where I ((develop my personality)), I mean in order to be fully independent on different aspects of my life and so.
S19-C03-R19_073183-074246	It was also a turning point in .. in my relationships with many people, as I got to know new people and other people .. I mean I got to know their character better or so, that's it, so this was actually the biggest turning point I mean.
S19-C03-R19_075204-076167	Honestly, it depends on time actually, if the time .. if it allows to be in groups and .. and to take breaks and to hang out and so, %b .. %b .. I prefer this actually.
S19-C03-R19_076167-077159	To work for some time then we have fun then take some breaks and then work again and so on, and also each comes up with an idea, so .. so it's faster actually.
S19-C03-R19_077159-077915	((If I got stuck)), I prefer actually that each one takes a task or so and it becomes more individual, that's it.
S19-C03-R19_079376-079974	Actually in the educational field, I'd say my father and mother because they are professors at the university.
S19-C03-R19_079974-081396	[HES] in the general field of life I mean, yes, I have around .. two or three friends that I believe I always take their opinion regarding almost everything and I notice how they act and I like their way of thinking I mean, so they are really role model for me.
S19-C03-R19_082409-083966	[HES] I mean I would like to be respected more because [HES] if liked, I might be liked because of behaving in a way that isn't really myself or behaving in a way just to make fun of myself in a certain place.
S19-C03-R19_083966-086208	Behaving in a way that isn't really myself or behaving in a way just to make fun of myself in a certain place.
S19-C03-R19_087464-089606	Honestly, I am the kind of a person that is not .. not .. I mean [HES] it's not easy to let people interact with me actually, but [HES] I mean when I feel that the other person is good, it actually becomes easy, and as long as there are common conversations and topics that we can talk about and so, no, I mean, I can talk and listen to others and so, actually.
S19-C03-R19_090638-092098	[HES] That really happens, I mean especially that I'm .. I'm not a very social person, I mean for me, I mean it's hard for me to deal with a new person, so this actually really happens I mean.
S19-C03-R19_093278-094330	Okay, I %b .. I mean I believe my best quality is that I %b .. think about .. think well about my decision before .. before I make it.
S19-C03-R19_094330-095037	[HES] I like .. I like to weigh factors .. with more rationalism, not .. that I don't make quick decisions.
S19-C03-R19_095037-095595	I don't like going with .. with the flow, in general, I mean, whether in .. in .. in any aspect of life.
S19-C03-R19_096755-098922	Actually the trait that ((I find hard to deal with)) is when a person cares only about having fun, I mean actually the person should care about having fun in life and everything but also when he faces any situation that requires seriousness or responsibility he should be .. be up to it, actually I really respect this point.
S19-C03-R19_100012-101724	Actually I think anything that requires responsibility or leadership, I mean I %b .. feel .. actually feel that it is a difficult situation if I am responsible for instance for people .. a lot of people in .. in a certain situation, or if I'm responsible for them or so, that's it, I believe this is the most thing that can stress me out actually.
S19-C03-R19_103199-104814	Honestly, I'm not good at this actually but I mean .. I mean ((if I'm trying to say any nonsense yes)) but then I reach a certain level where I won't .. I won't be able to talk so actually I try to change the topic in any way.
S19-C03-R19_105694-106171	[HES] without a mobile?
S19-C03-R19_106171-107576	I did that for a while actually so I felt that the issue isn't .. isn't .. isn't hard I mean when I was in high school, %ma .. I didn't have a mobile, or I had a mobile but I had no social media, so I think the main use of the mobile is social media, that's it
S19-C03-R19_107576-108654	[HES] so I yes, I mean, I can, but not for a long time actually, actually regarding social media, I won't .. won't be highly affected as long as I can meet the people that I want to talk to, I mean.
S19-C03-R19_109573-110650	[HES] I believe that .. that my working space should be in the highest level actually.
S19-C03-R19_110650-112468	Whether, for instance, my field is computer science so I'm supposed to have my .. my .. working space as an office with LED lights, with a good sound system, with a good screen because .. and to have .. have a coffee machine because if I don't have a coffee machine I won't study, that's it.
S19-C03-R19_112468-114108	And as long as my .. my .. my space looks nice and good, I will be more creative at work, whether in .. in .. in my study, in my job, in .. in .. in anything related to design for instance or so or requires creativity or so.
S19-C03-R19_114108-115152	That's it, so if you want to %t .. no matter what your field is, it's a must that the .. the place where you are sitting or working looks nice I mean.
S22-C03-R22_001283-001691	Okay I was born in .. here in Cairo.
S22-C03-R22_001691-002623	I was born .. I was born in Shoubra, and I went to school in .. I mean national school, it was in Ramses.
S22-C03-R22_002623-003290	And I stayed at this school actually all .. the whole time, I mean since KG one .. from KG one until ..
S22-C03-R22_003845-004298	And .. and now I live in Heliopolis actually, but I was born in ..
S22-C03-R22_004733-005501	The school was English language school and actually we studied English and French and .. and .. and that's all, but English was the main language actually.
S22-C03-R22_006642-006851	I didn't want to attend university, but no, I'm just joking.
S22-C03-R22_006851-007329	No, I joined university, I mean .. I mean that joining the GUC was .. was almost by coincidence actually.
S22-C03-R22_007329-007943	And during semester one, ((I had no idea which path I want to go for in engineering)), ((I was going with the flow)) .
S22-C03-R22_008457-008705	In semester two, I felt that I really had to choose.
S22-C03-R22_008705-010268	In semester 1, I was about to fail CS, CS one, but I decided to ((deal with it)), and in semester 2, I focused on CS2, learned it and studied it and ((I exerted a lot of effort)), and in the end, I actually suspected that I might be interested in CS.
S22-C03-R22_010498-010905	I did not like all the rest, I suspected that I am interested in that one [LAUGHTER], so I chose that one, I mean.
S22-C03-R22_011817-012233	My study at the university involves that we %b .. I mean of course it's mainly coding.
S22-C03-R22_012233-013196	DMET study media .. actually more of media or signals and things of that sort, but we study CS MET which is ((basically)) coding software more than hardware actually.
S22-C03-R22_013394-014450	We developed games before, we created application .. web applications, we developed .. we worked on software which is full stack development.
S22-C03-R22_014450-015056	We worked on hardware as well, embedded systems and so, and actually we really almost worked on everything actually.
S22-C03-R22_015056-015454	Regarding my project, I'm working mainly on hardware as well.
S22-C03-R22_015454-015913	I'm working on a project called Vehicle Infrastructure Communication.
S22-C03-R22_015913-017066	What's that? That is that any kind of vehicle, say a car, for instance, this car, it should communicate with any kind of infrastructure.
S22-C03-R22_017066-018742	Why? In order to actually receive data or to pass data, I mean, about the road status, about .. about the current speed or actually .. actually what's my maximum speed limit, about, for instance, if I'm approaching a working zone, I mean a working zone, for instance, to slow down.
S22-C03-R22_018781-019433	Or for example, there's an approaching traffic light that is right light, so no, stop and you have 10 meters to stop following a certain speed.
S22-C03-R22_019433-019762	And so on, that's my project, it is mainly a communication model actually.
S22-C03-R22_020452-022241	Okay. My daily routine hasn't been really clear for a while actually, but as far as I remember .. as far as I remember I used to, no actually, really wake up .. wake up .. wake up a bit early, wake up before 9 and then I sit alone in complete silence in my bedroom.
S22-C03-R22_022241-022853	And after sitting quietly in my bedroom, of course after washing my face, and ((so on)), I go to the kitchen to prepare coffee.
S22-C03-R22_022853-023410	And then I take my coffee and go to my bedroom, I keep sitting in silence once more doing nothing, I don't even hold my mobile or anything at all.
S22-C03-R22_023410-023966	But, after a while, I start planning in this .. in this tranquility, I mean, I plan what I'm going to do in my day actually.
S22-C03-R22_024078-025146	((I write down my to-do list)), for instance, one, two, three, I have meetings, I have studying, I have so and so, I have a quiz coming up, next Wednesday, ((whatever)), and after ((organizing everything)), I start working actually in the .. in the normal day, I mean.
S22-C03-R22_025871-026415	I have hobbies that I practice during the weekend and other hobbies that I normally practice or other things that I like in general.
S22-C03-R22_026415-026893	I .. I love swimming very much, in summer I swim during weekends.
S22-C03-R22_026893-027368	And I love I usually like reading and like writing.
S22-C03-R22_027368-027660	Writing in Arabic and reading .. actually I write in English as well.
S22-C03-R22_027660-028729	Writing .. you mean what am I writing about? I write [HES], I mean, an article for instance about an important topic or even about a silly topic, I mean, that is a hot topic right now, an ongoing one, an event that took place, ((and so on)) .
S22-C03-R22_028729-029468	[BREATH] I write English stories as well, these stories are a maximum of fifteen pages for instance, but in English as well or in Arabic.
S22-C03-R22_029468-029767	I like .. like holding on to a topic actually and working on it.
S22-C03-R22_029767-031050	And I read, I like reading philosophy and I like reading,, actually, reading novels and I like reading other books, I mean, about .. existentialism books and such things actually, this is, I mean, that's in general.
S22-C03-R22_031050-031476	And actually besides tennis, I used to play ping pong actually.
S22-C03-R22_031542-031779	Besides swimming, sorry [LAUGHTER]
S22-C03-R22_032753-033037	[HUM] I have a nice quote.
S22-C03-R22_033332-035601	There is a quote that I like, actually .. actually I can't remember who said it, but someone I like very much said it, someone who is actually a public figure. It says, if you failed .. if you failed to .. to plan so you plan to fail, if you .. if you fail to plan, you plan to fail".
S22-C03-R22_035601-036145	It emphasizes the importance of planning, to plan for my day, for my life, and for my week and so on.
S22-C03-R22_037071-038823	I'm not a big fan of movies actually, but [HES] I mean the last movie I watched was a war movie called .. actually I don't remember its name now, but I mean, anyways.
S22-C03-R22_038823-039899	Actually it was .. was about the World War and .. I cannot remember whether it was the first or the second or what exactly, but it was describing how difficult life was at that time and it was focusing more on stories of soldiers that .. that are in the army, what they used to do.
S22-C03-R22_039899-040931	It was talking about their quality of life, about how difficult it was, it discussed how, for instance, there was no food, which was very hard, in addition to continuous noise and fire shooting, not only noise, I mean people dying and you losing friends all of a sudden.
S22-C03-R22_040931-041670	It was going more into depth on what happens in war, if I remember the movie .. the movie's name I will tell you I mean, that's it .
S22-C03-R22_042695-043297	I have a lot of books of course but actually I .. I really like novels of Naguib Mahfouz.
S22-C03-R22_043297-043918	Naguib Mahfouz is a writer, I mean he was definitely a mark in history I mean.
S22-C03-R22_044029-045355	I read for him before [HES], there is .. there is a novel called Afrah al-Kobba and there is another novel called .. I'm trying to remember it because it really influenced me, that very big one .. I don't remember actually .
S22-C03-R22_045436-045494	What?
S22-C03-R22_045633-047051	[HES] It talked about a person living in a palace alone, and that person was ((cruel)), and he didn't know, and actually there was nobody .. who competes with him, he was like .. like a God on is own ((and his sons and daughters were suffering)) with him and ((so)) and then he dismissed his son.
S22-C03-R22_047102-047420	I mean it's a difficult story actually, that's it.
S22-C03-R22_047420-048325	And there are also the philosophical books, of course, many books have influenced me, but the last book that actually really inspired me is called who's the human being?
S22-C03-R22_048325-049172	This book was written by an author called Zakaria Ibrahim, he is a ((genuine)) Egyptian philosopher actually.
S22-C03-R22_049922-050256	I didn't want this question to be asked, really, I didn't want this question to be asked.
S22-C03-R22_050256-051734	No, actually .. actually I .. I'm a kind of person %ma .. actually %ma .. I can't easily go forward for only one thing unless I'm sure that I have passion for it and I'm very interested in it and ((I can do it very well)) I mean.
S22-C03-R22_051734-052322	That's it, so honestly, I think of, for instance, a million things, which I like all very much.
S22-C03-R22_052322-052882	I really love things related to psychology, I like .. although I'm studying engineering actually, I love things related to psychology.
S22-C03-R22_052882-053456	And I like the .. for instance, human resources, and I like the .. I like CS as well, as I've mentioned, actually.
S22-C03-R22_053456-054050	[HES] [COUGH] I'd love to work as a writer ((somewhere)), in a magazine or a newspaper or so.
S22-C03-R22_054050-056103	And I'd love to work as a detective, I have no idea about this job in Egypt actually, actually ((I have a lot on mind)) but ((I can't really make up my mind)), but probably for now I mean, I mean probably probably I will go for the first opportunity I get, ((that is to start with)), however, priority one is my faculty as much as I can actually, which is computer science
S22-C03-R22_057082-058204	Okay I I really want to attend .. I mean and do an internship in .. in the .. I mean for the university, because I need to graduate I mean, that's all.
S22-C03-R22_058204-058674	I didn't attend any internships related to the university, but I did work in other places, yes.
S22-C03-R22_058674-059986	I worked as a teacher before in .. in .. not at a nursery actually, but .. but involving kids up to eleven years old, that's it, and I worked as a teacher, nothing in particular, ((it was more about morale actually)) .
S22-C03-R22_059986-060387	We talk about .. about who is the girl? and who is the boy? .. and who is the boy?
S22-C03-R22_060516-061113	We talk about the .. some awareness I mean and something of that sort, I mean, that's it
S22-C03-R22_061113-062243	And I worked before in the field of sales and marketing for tennis equipments, that was a long time ago, five or six years ago for example.
S22-C03-R22_063485-065256	Actually, I also, the .. actually .. actually I can't say that I have lived a working life, I mean I have just spent a few months working or .. or I mean it's not a big deal, but I have always wanted to be involved in working life actually.
S22-C03-R22_065256-066274	((In other words)), I wish to quit university [LAUGHTER] I wish .. really, I mean, I wish to finish college to be by .. by myself I mean, that's it, to start planning what exactly I want to do.
S22-C03-R22_066662-067082	I have never traveled, but I tried and it didn't work actually.
S22-C03-R22_067653-067849	I think Switzerland.
S22-C03-R22_067849-067990	Why?
S22-C03-R22_067990-068456	Switzerland because actually, ((from the outside)), it's a beautiful country I mean.
S22-C03-R22_068456-068673	And its reputation, to a great extent, is good [LAUGHTER] .
S22-C03-R22_068673-069233	That's it, and there are .. there will be places to hang out and .. and ((similar places)) I mean, it's a good country.
S22-C03-R22_070564-071072	Actually I .. without hesitating, I won't do that, and this is very weird.
S22-C03-R22_071072-071651	[HES] Actually I will probably think about it as I would any other opportunity that ((I get)) all of a sudden I mean.
S22-C03-R22_071651-072846	That's it, as a very normal person, I will think about ((the nature of the job)), and its description and its location and so on and immigration and so on and so on and so on, but in the end, I will decide to settle here actually.
S22-C03-R22_072846-073754	Why do I want to stay here? I have many reasons actually .. many reasons, one of which is a reason, that you might find weird actually, but I believe they need me more here.
S22-C03-R22_074253-074894	Here, they need people .. here I mean .. here they need people to work I mean, they need people %t .. to develop I mean.
S22-C03-R22_076211-078124	Okay I traveled once with my relatives, actually they .. they are my friends before being my relatives actually, we are all in the same age range as well, boys ((and so)) and girls and so and so on, one time we went to the .. to the .. Hurghada, that was really nice actually.
S22-C03-R22_078124-079870	Why? We almost did everything in it actually, everything that can be done in Hurghada, we did it, really everything actually, snorkeling and diving and .. and the .. and we swam in the pool of course and .. and we played tennis and we played football and we did safari, actually everything that can be done, we did it, and we it was so much fun actually.
S22-C03-R22_081034-081286	A moment in my life that I felt was a turning point?
S22-C03-R22_081286-083001	I believe yes, I mean I believe there is .. actually in the start of my freshman year, I started to be more independent in different aspects, that I didn't use to be independent in before I mean, actually in .. on the moment I decided to be fully independent.
S22-C03-R22_083001-083908	Actually not .. actually I didn't work alone abroad and earned money and so, that's not what I meant, but there were some things ((internally)) I mean, that I decided ((to be fully independent in)) actually.
S22-C03-R22_085046-085586	I honestly love my friends, so for sure I'd love to work .. in a team.
S22-C03-R22_085586-087323	It is actually .. actually work is better and we are actually .. actually psychologically better I mean, more outgoing and we have fun and .. and nobody is under stress and even if we are under stress, we're together, in group, that are you friends as well, it is much better that being on your own.
S22-C03-R22_087323-087850	And if I face a problem, somebody helps me out, and if he faces a problem we help one another.
S22-C03-R22_087850-088689	It is actually .. actually work is better and we are actually .. actually psychologically better I mean, more outgoing and we have fun and .. and nobody is under stress and even if we are under stress, we're together, in group, that are you friends as well, it is much better that being on your own.
S22-C03-R22_090484-090710	Okay I will not mention a name, okay?
S22-C03-R22_090896-091931	Okay well I mean I .. I like somebody very much, he is dear to me I mean, he .. he is a public figure actually, okay, actually, I honestly [HES] don't prefer saying his name I mean.
S22-C03-R22_091931-093876	But he is a public figure who travels abroad .. he %by .. a speaker I mean a speaker %b .. %by .. talks to people and so on, he talks to thousands and millions of people actually, and he is Egyptian, what I like is that he is Egyptian, and .. and he gives speeches here actually in Egypt and outside Egypt, ((he has almost traveled everywhere)) .
S22-C03-R22_093876-094595	%by .. %by .. %by .. I mean he knows how to address people, and to actually reach them and is able to %y .. to help them in general I mean.
S22-C03-R22_095392-096111	Okay actually I think respected, actually.
S22-C03-R22_096111-096325	Why so?
S22-C03-R22_096325-098818	I will be more comfortable in .. or I will be more comfortable with someone %b .. who respects me more actually, not just that he .. he or she I mean, I don't know, someone likes me, no, but, actually, that is he respects me, ((I will feel at ease)), I ((can talk more freely)), I can talk and .. and feel comfortable I mean and ((not worry about anything)) and ((be easy going)) actually.
S22-C03-R22_099879-100393	I am a simple person but difficult to deal with actually [LAUGHTER]
S22-C03-R22_100393-102187	Not because I'm a difficult person, but the ice breaking .. the ice breaking I think actually for me is .. is difficult in the beginning, but once we are past ice breaking, I became at ease and I think I'm loved actually from the people who get to know me.
S22-C03-R22_103172-104306	No, not at all, I don't feel .. I don't feel that way at all nearly, but .. but I also like to make the other person comfortable while being with me, and not to feel that there is any .. any .. any problem or any difference actually.
S22-C03-R22_104306-105525	As much as I can, I try to give him the .. the image [HES] the .. the image I mean .. I mean .. I mean the image that he needs to be able to converse I mean, and sit together without problems I mean.
S22-C03-R22_106458-107154	That I am confident actually, but I think this it is a trait that I have and I don't want to ever lose it actually.
S22-C03-R22_108298-108723	It might be a good question, I haven't thought about it before.
S22-C03-R22_108723-109829	[HES] I mean .. I mean I %ma .. I don't know actually the term that you would accept, but I can't deal with somebody of weak IQ.
S22-C03-R22_109829-111261	Actually I don't mean that he is very stupid or .. or there is a problem and I'm making fun of him, no, but I can't really deal with someone who ((doesn't concentrate in any way)) or .. or who he has any kind of low IQ I mean.
S22-C03-R22_112916-113719	[HES] No, I mean, this has never happened to me before, but .. but I mean I was trying to do so [LAUGHTER] .
S22-C03-R22_113719-114319	I tried and I failed and the person got upset and knew I was bluffing [LAUGHTER] and so on I mean.
S22-C03-R22_114319-114843	No, no, no, really, actually, no, I did that before and .. but I don't think it worked actually.
S22-C03-R22_115483-116869	I can live without a mobile phone, yes, I did it before, but .. but of course for a limited period of time, because .. because there are things that I really need the mobile for, I need social media, it's a must, no way not to call anybody, I have to call someone.
S22-C03-R22_116869-117369	So I can live without a mobile phone for a limited period of time actually, and there are certain types of responsibilities that ((I must be exempted from)) .
S22-C03-R22_118802-118958	Both of you love dogs?
S22-C03-R22_119807-120044	Okay why are you afraid of dogs?
S22-C03-R22_120902-122600	Okay, honestly I .. actually I .. actually I .. I understand this very well, but, In my opinion if you are convinced that the dog is harmless and you made sure that he is harmless, you will be able to deal with it normally, because, some dogs unfortunately, are indeed harmful, but there are pretty normal dogs.
S22-C03-R22_122600-123800	On the contrary, actually, I believe It's not only about dogs' barking and so, but you can have fun with some dogs and it you can %t .. go for a walk, for instance you can take it for a walk, for a while for instance, and your friends can play with it and have fun together.
S22-C03-R22_123905-124278	And you can %t .. travel with it and take a nice photo with it that you can post on facebook.
S22-C03-R22_124278-125086	Actually .. actually if you get used to or .. or .. or .. understand that the dog is harmless, and it turns out that it really is harmless, I actually think it will be easy.
S24-C03-R24_001699-001916	I'm originally from here, from Cairo.
S24-C03-R24_001916-002293	Do I need to speak in one language?
S24-C03-R24_002366-002521	It's okay? okay.
S24-C03-R24_002521-004002	My school was a national school, but English was very well-taught there actually, so thank God [LAUGHTER] I was well based in English [HES] currently working as a TA.
S24-C03-R24_004002-005178	[HES] Actually I can say that I did not count for working a TA anytime in my life actually, so it's a new experience for me.
S24-C03-R24_005178-006422	[HES] I don't know honestly what else shall I say, actually, my family, in general, was a bit conservative so I feel that I was raised in this way.
S24-C03-R24_006422-006550	And that's it.
S24-C03-R24_007973-008199	[HES] Okay [LAUGHTER] .
S24-C03-R24_008199-008581	[HES] I studied Engineering, my major was digital media.
S24-C03-R24_008581-009399	[HES] The bachelor project was Quran pronunciation system, but I was responsible for the GUI, so it was mainly design.
S24-C03-R24_009399-010108	After I graduated college, I traveled abroad and I completed a 3D workshop certificate.
S24-C03-R24_010108-010324	At New York Film Academy.
S24-C03-R24_011698-012561	Okay, for digital media if you have seen its curriculum, it's sort of getting some stuff from every major actually.
S24-C03-R24_012561-014514	So for a while we studied audio and acoustics, we studied introduction to .. to media as in how to actually create 3D effects, what's behind the scenes, how does mayo work, how does the 3D Max works, [HES] mathematics, physics.
S24-C03-R24_014514-016528	All that stuff that engineers tends to study but we can add to that that we had an idea about CS, we have an idea about CS, we have an idea about the majors surrounding .. surrounding us, but at the end we become .. I don't know .. [LAUGHTER] I don't know, at the end, it might be that we have tackled actually a bit of each major actually, that's it.
S24-C03-R24_017093-018477	Okay [Noise] [HES] Okay I wake up, of course, I mean, I perform wudu and pray and wake my son up and take him to the nursery, either I drive him or the driver, then I come to the university.
S24-C03-R24_018477-019062	I have tutorials but only twice a week, this means two days a week, of course, not twice [LAUGHTER] .
S24-C03-R24_019062-019251	They are definitely more than that.
S24-C03-R24_019251-019873	[HES] I can prepare a lunch box of course before I go for my son.
S24-C03-R24_019873-020374	[HES] ((I prepare the components needed to prepare food when I return home)) [HES]
S24-C03-R24_020374-020908	[HES] I tidy his room so that we don't return so I'm not overloaded with work when I return home I mean [HES] .
S24-C03-R24_020908-021061	[HES] And that's it.
S24-C03-R24_021061-021273	Then, as I said, I go to the university actually.
S24-C03-R24_022021-023099	Okay, regarding weekends, we spend it at my family's place actually, I go to my family's place on Thursday and come back on Friday and on Saturday we go out as a family, Mohamed and I.
S24-C03-R24_023199-023662	I said their names but it's [LAUGHTER] okay.
S24-C03-R24_023662-024000	[HES] my hobbies, I like reading very much.
S24-C03-R24_024000-025397	[HES] And I'm very good at drawing and I used to enjoy drawing, but now I don't have the patience to continue a drawing till the end actually, I draw like start like a scratch or something and .. and that's it, ((thank you)) .
S24-C03-R24_025397-025528	A sketch, sorry not scratch
S24-C03-R24_025528-025918	[HES] What else?
S24-C03-R24_025918-027361	I go to the gym, I really love to exercise, and recently I have been trying to do that three times a week because ((when I don't go regularly, I don't go at all)), so I try to go regularly I mean in order not to get bored sorry %ma .. not to be lazy.
S24-C03-R24_028786-029711	Okay I like reading mainly the Genre I mean it's historic novels either in Arabic or in English.
S24-C03-R24_029711-030231	I like reading ordinary novels, I like reading ordinary books, it can be a bit religious books.
S24-C03-R24_030231-031026	But what I really like the most is reading a novel that talks interestingly about a certain period of time in history actually.
S24-C03-R24_031026-031826	The book that I have read and liked the most .. I can't say that it's only one book, but there's one book that I keep reading from time to time, it's called The Granada Trilogy by Radwa Ashour.
S24-C03-R24_031826-033308	[HES] I really like novels that talk about the last period in .. in Al Andalus, but .. but with regards to families, I mean how the lives of families went on over, for instance, fifty years.
S24-C03-R24_033367-033991	[HES] It's all about three books but there is one book actually, as if the three parts are collected in one book.
S24-C03-R24_035102-035410	I'm addicted to movies, to start with, and to ENGLISH movies.
S24-C03-R24_035410-035922	[HES] The last movie I watched was Tully.
S24-C03-R24_035922-036355	Tully [HES] is a story of a mother of three.
S24-C03-R24_036355-037737	She had some sort of a mental illness or as they call it post pregnancy depression, but she wasn't aware of that.
S24-C03-R24_038007-038464	She thought that she was getting some help from a night nanny but actually it was her.
S24-C03-R24_038464-039007	I mean she was seeing someone as another person but it was her when she was young.
S24-C03-R24_039007-039746	[HES] so it's a sort of give me actually a feeling that I'm not alone.
S24-C03-R24_039746-040589	All mothers have this sort of [LAUGHTER] depression moments that they don't know what to do, so it's not that bad to seek for help.
S24-C03-R24_040765-041012	Okay [HES] ..
S24-C03-R24_041822-041864	A son.
S24-C03-R24_042859-042898	Okay.
S24-C03-R24_043010-043348	It's international and the reason is obvious.
S24-C03-R24_043348-043933	That currently the, I mean, .. the education in here is not that robust.
S24-C03-R24_044211-044663	The International education is sort of seeking something better, I'm not going to say it's the best, but it's better.
S24-C03-R24_044663-045974	[HES] the language is English because it's the most common language but that doesn't mean that I won't let him learn another language, on the contrary, I'd really want him to know more than three or four languages.
S24-C03-R24_045974-046656	[HES] So whatever language he wants to %l .. to learn, I will help him do that.
S24-C03-R24_046656-047820	[HES] I can say that I want him to learn German and .. and French and some might .. might find this weird but I .. I really wanted to do so, and Hebrew.
S24-C03-R24_047820-047878	I don't know.
S24-C03-R24_047948-048906	I mean I feel like it's very, it has to be done, I mean I must understand their language [LAUGHTER] .
S24-C03-R24_048906-049479	But .. but if he doesn't want to, of course I won't force him to do anything I mean, but I really wish to learn.
S24-C03-R24_049479-049837	[HES] Anyhow, what was the question?
S24-C03-R24_049956-051381	Okay, I also want to add something, (( international is not just for the sake of international)), I'm not going to enroll him in an any international school, I will enroll him in a school that I'm pretty sure that the community in there is not that bad and it is not going to affect him in a very bad way.
S24-C03-R24_051381-051856	I mean I seek people with similar mindset as mine, so I will try to seek something similar actually.
S24-C03-R24_052786-053015	Okay he's now two years and a half.
S24-C03-R24_053015-054468	His nursery teaches, unfortunately, English only, but it's not because I want him to learn English but, because I couldn't find any nursery that has good cultural, social and educational level in my area except for this one actually or even similar ones I mean.
S24-C03-R24_054468-055755	So this was the best as it doesn't .. doesn't, for instance, take him from his culture and puts him in another %cul .. totally different culture, but the idea is, that they learn in English as there are a lot of foreigners in this area actually.
S24-C03-R24_055755-056245	[HES] but when I try to teach him at home, I try to speak in Arabic only.
S24-C03-R24_056245-056424	[HES] I'm the one who's teaching him Arabic.
S24-C03-R24_056424-057815	I'm trying to teach him words, I get him cards, I read books with him, I may read Quran in front of him, in order to let him read Arabic well I mean, but actually I prefer to talk to him in Arabic actually [LAUGHTER] .
S24-C03-R24_058563-059577	Look, my dream job was that I would own my own cartoon production company.
S24-C03-R24_059832-060848	That's why I attended college and chose digital media engineering especially in the first place, because.
S24-C03-R24_060848-061947	[HES] I thought that it was really related to what I wanted to learn, I won't say that I got disappointed and that my dreams were destroyed, but for sure I got down, when I saw the way of or the type of courses that I take, that not all of them are related to things that I love.
S24-C03-R24_061947-062304	And this is why ((I stumbled a lot)) in college until I graduated.
S24-C03-R24_062304-063036	Actually I suffered a bit because I don't like studying something that I don't like .. something that I don't like I mean, I have to study something that I feel passionate about.
S24-C03-R24_063201-064228	When I was in the third year of college, I decided that I will pass what don't really like and I will give my full attention to what I like, even if I don't get a good grade in the .. in the paper, but I .. I understood.
S24-C03-R24_064278-064316	Okay?
S24-C03-R24_064316-064929	So I after I finished college, ((to get closer to my goal)), I took a 3D course.
S24-C03-R24_064929-066994	But at the same time, at that time I was about to .. to have a baby, I mean, so I had to stop %wo .. I mean working, because working in this .. this field needed continuous update of my portfolio and I did not have that much time to make a portfolio.
S24-C03-R24_066994-068689	So I considered maybe after two or three years that I need to .. no, sorry two years, that I might work as a TA and actually, actually, it does not feel that bad, I mean, to my surprise, I was happy about it.
S24-C03-R24_068689-069297	But I did not forgot .. forget my last dream, it's postponed.
S24-C03-R24_070288-071129	Okay I had worked in .. in a company here in Egypt actually, but it's not Egyptian.
S24-C03-R24_071201-071561	I believe that it had a part that's multinational.
S24-C03-R24_071561-072408	But I worked for like two months or so, I was part of the web development team, but they didn't let me work a lot [HES] [LAUGHTER] .
S24-C03-R24_072408-073355	I sort of listened a lot and tried to learn, but actual work, no, I didn't take part in projects, but I used to learn from them actually.
S24-C03-R24_074798-075386	Look, this is a tough question.
S24-C03-R24_075386-077806	When I was a student, it was totally different because back then I was not married, I did not have a kid and I did not have a house of my own, so for sure being a student was much less stressing that now, but at the same time I feel now that I I'm having full control of my life and this is actually a pro against some cons, I mean.
S24-C03-R24_077806-078515	But also it .. it feels good to less responsible so maybe I will to say that prefer being a student [LAUGHTER] .
S24-C03-R24_079150-080079	Yes I traveled twice, once to the east and once to an Arabic country.
S24-C03-R24_080181-081119	But I enjoyed traveling actually, so when I get the chance and have an amount of money that is preserved, I might consider traveling again, I mean.
S24-C03-R24_082279-082824	I like everywhere I went, but the Arabic country, I don't know whether I am allowed to say the name.
S24-C03-R24_082899-083020	I adore Lebanon.
S24-C03-R24_083020-083460	I am willing to go and live in Lebanon actually, I can pay anything just to live there.
S24-C03-R24_083460-084587	[HES] and actually, truly, when I get a second chance, I will revisit it, even if at the expense of another country that I haven't visited, because it's amazing, ((not to be missed)) I mean [LAUGHTER] .
S24-C03-R24_085469-086203	[HES] I wish to travel to so many places, actually.
S24-C03-R24_086203-086625	This is such a difficult question, by the way.
S24-C03-R24_086625-087338	I can say that I haven't visited any European country, so I really wish to take a tour there.
S24-C03-R24_087377-087692	And especially the Scandinavian countries.
S24-C03-R24_087692-088217	But a specific place, no, I wish I go all over the world.
S24-C03-R24_088217-088414	I don't have something in particular [LAUGHTER] .
S24-C03-R24_089824-091168	[HES] I can take this decision, but I have to be with my family, I mean I don't mind, actually my family doesn't mind that I travel abroad, but we should be together, not ..
S24-C03-R24_091168-091843	I cannot travel alone and I won't let anyone travel without me as we should try to preserve our family
S24-C03-R24_092905-093725	[HES] When I had a baby, actually everything changed when I .. when I had a baby.
S24-C03-R24_093725-094636	[HES] My total perspective of life is that. okay, now I'm responsible of a human being.
S24-C03-R24_094636-095093	Actually it's not like being responsible of my studies or my work or even my house.
S24-C03-R24_095093-097403	I mean, I .. when .. when I got married, it was like living with someone, and that's all I mean, I mean we shared the house, but having a baby is like, I don't know how to say this, but, you are responsible for every single thing that this child sees, eats, thinks of, learns, hears, everything
S24-C03-R24_097403-098091	You are his only resource of life especially during his first years.
S24-C03-R24_098091-099326	He has nobody else to go to except you, so it's kind of tiring, but at the same time, it's a huge responsibility and it needs love to be fulfilled, so, no, it was very ..
S24-C03-R24_100125-100990	Look, I'm I'm not a team person but actually at university ((we had a lot of tasks)), so when there is an individual project, ((I get lost)) .
S24-C03-R24_101076-102515	To work in a team, but this doesn't mean that I was enjoyed, I enjoy being with my friends but to distribute tasks and to have someone lag and someone lead, and someone with no idea what to do and so on, I might have been overloading my teammates and vice versa.
S24-C03-R24_102515-102907	So, no, I'm not a teams person.
S24-C03-R24_102907-102999	Not in everything.
S24-C03-R24_102999-103186	Sometimes yes and sometimes no, that's all.
S24-C03-R24_105251-106205	[HES] Okay so I might say that I look up to many people in different things.
S24-C03-R24_106205-106864	Actually it can be that someone does a specific thing in a very perfect way that I, okay, I really like to be like him.
S24-C03-R24_106864-107210	[HES] Someone else who has something else special.
S24-C03-R24_107210-107278	Someone at home.
S24-C03-R24_107278-107495	I'm really proud of my parents of course.
S24-C03-R24_107495-107836	[HES] I mean I look up to be like them one day.
S24-C03-R24_107836-108790	My grandfather is my ultimate role model, may his soul rest in peace, so I definitely wish ((I could be half the person he is)) .
S24-C03-R24_108790-109168	But in my life, in general, I sort of look.
S24-C03-R24_109168-110074	In, actually, everybody I know, is there a perfect thing that might be able to achieve like him one day or not?
S24-C03-R24_110074-110545	This is how I measure being a role model for me or not actually, that's it.
S24-C03-R24_111341-111855	Can't we say that they are the same?
S24-C03-R24_111855-113111	Actually being liked will always have some respect in it, I mean, if somebody likes me, ((he won't feel find me silly)), I mean, there is definitely some sort of respect.
S24-C03-R24_113111-113616	But being liked is more affectionate, so I might choose liked not over respected actually.
S24-C03-R24_114545-115279	No, I can say that I can easily talk to him, but if I don't accept the other person, it won't be easy for him to talk to me at all [LAUGHTER] .
S24-C03-R24_115279-115562	Actually I will ..
S24-C03-R24_116515-117088	[HES] No, no, but I take care.
S24-C03-R24_120953-121363	That I regret many things and I feel guilty quickly [LAUGHTER] .
S24-C03-R24_121428-122166	This doesn't mean that I don't make any mistakes, but I really feel guilty, so at least this makes me think about what I did, whether it was right or wrong, that's all.
S24-C03-R24_122837-123384	If the other person is ((very aggressive)) since I'm very aggressive, so both of us %hn .. [LAUGHTER] .
S24-C03-R24_123450-123794	[LAUGHTER] ((we will fight)) [LAUGHTER], that's all.
S24-C03-R24_125126-125230	Yes, it happened [LAUGHTER] .
S24-C03-R24_125301-126873	It happened before, but actually I used to try to explain my understanding, if they understood then great, if not, I did my best, but ((I didn't say things that anybody would ask me more about)) ((so as not to mess things up)) .
S24-C03-R24_126931-127081	That's it, actually.
S24-C03-R24_127535-127996	Most probably, yes, it passed [LAUGHTER] .
S24-C03-R24_128326-128376	No.
S24-C03-R24_128406-130207	But, not because of the internet, but because it's the only way that I can connect with some people, so I don't think I can stay uninformed about certain important people in my life for a long period of time, I can't wait until I go home to use the landline to be able to call them.
S24-C03-R24_130207-130364	It makes this easier.
S24-C03-R24_132441-132983	It might be that all people should read.
S24-C03-R24_133343-134192	I don't know how I can say this but reading can have you traveling to too many worlds that aren't .. aren't I won't say countries while sitting at your place.
S24-C03-R24_134192-134618	It's even sometimes hard to get back to your life after reading a good book.
S24-C03-R24_134618-135198	[HES] It's like you are captured with the characters or with the events that happened in the book.
S24-C03-R24_135198-135787	So, how come anybody would miss the opportunity of doing everything he wants while sitting in his place?
S24-C03-R24_135787-136187	But [HES] [LAUGHTER] you have to read [LAUGHTER] .
S24-C03-R24_136311-136376	You're welcome.
S26-C03-R26_001199-001882	Okay [HES] I was in a national school [HES] but it was a language school.
S26-C03-R26_001882-002656	I used to study everything in English and in third primary we started studying French and I kept studying French until second secondary.
S26-C03-R26_002656-003300	[HES] and then from where am I? I'm from Cairo.
S26-C03-R26_003300-004010	And I lived in El Haram for some time then we moved to Heliopolis in Masaken Sheraton.
S26-C03-R26_005021-005575	Okay I had already decided that I wanted to go for the math section when I was selecting the major in general secondary.
S26-C03-R26_005575-006568	And .. and after that although everyone saw me as a a doctor and told me no, you should join the Faculty of Medicine, but no I decided to go for the math section and that I want to join engineering.
S26-C03-R26_006568-007605	And then [HES] I chose engineering because I like scientific subjects and devices and playing with hardware devices.
S26-C03-R26_007605-007824	And I wanted to join Mechatronics.
S26-C03-R26_007991-008668	In the first year, I found us studying math and physics and I was introduced to CS, I really liked it.
S26-C03-R26_008668-010312	And I felt that I got good grades, then in the midterm exam, everyone wasn't able to solve it and some getting and some failing and some getting low grades and I found that I got ninety nine point four, ((oh my!)), no, it looks like I will love this subject and I will continue studying it.
S26-C03-R26_010312-010779	And then when I was supposed to choose, I was still hesitant between Mechatronics and .. and CS.
S26-C03-R26_010779-011672	And I went to ask TAs here and TAs there, I felt that no, I'm more interested in .. in CS and .. and thank God, honestly, I'm I'm happy with my decision.
S26-C03-R26_012710-013264	Okay, the Bachelor project at first I was working on something called adaptive music player.
S26-C03-R26_013264-014395	It was about a sound system, if any house has a sound system with speakers everywhere, I'm supposed to turn on these speakers based on the location of the user.
S26-C03-R26_014395-015377	This means that .. that the system identifies which room the user or the house owner is in, then it turns on the speakers in this room only and turn off the others.
S26-C03-R26_015377-016362	Well what if the .. the room is very big, so for instance he is sitting on one side of the room and the other side is far away, so it also turns on the speakers on his side and turns off the others.
S26-C03-R26_016362-017007	[HES] because actually it's as in that he saves the in the consumption of the .. the power and things like that.
S26-C03-R26_017007-017340	I have just started working on the masters.
S26-C03-R26_017340-018225	[HES] It's called .. I mean, or it's objective is the reduction of pollution emitted from cars.
S26-C03-R26_018225-018478	Air pollution and noise pollution.
S26-C03-R26_018478-018928	How is that? That's a very long story.
S26-C03-R26_019538-021056	Okay, on working days, ((I find it hard to wake up)), I dress up and .. and drink coffee and .. and I rush to catch the bus, I run after it, catch it somewhere faraway, actually, morning adventures with the bus.
S26-C03-R26_021056-022792	And then I arrive at the university, I either attend lectures or correct sheets or work on the Masters or teaching, If I have teaching, I go for the tutorials or labs, then I go sleep in the bus and I go home to have lunch.
S26-C03-R26_022792-023350	I can nap or I can stay a while until I sleep at night, then the same routine is repeated five days a week.
S26-C03-R26_023350-024838	On the weekends [HES] on Thursday I .. my day off is Thursday, so my best friend's day off is Thursday as well, so every Thursday we decide to hang out in the morning, nobody else is free on Thursday except for us, so we decide to hang out in the morning.
S26-C03-R26_024838-025800	Once we had our breakfast or had the lunch over the Nile and once we went to El Moez street and so on, we have fun on Thursday morning because everyone is busy at work and we are free.
S26-C03-R26_026343-026629	I used to like drawing very much before.
S26-C03-R26_026629-027430	Not perfect drawing, but I used to like drawing and I used to like reading, but now, I still like them both, but I don't have the time for them like before.
S26-C03-R26_028191-029026	I like cooking very, very, very much and I still do it till now and, God willing, my future plans is to start selling it, that's it.
S26-C03-R26_029953-030743	I love reading in Arabic, and I still love reading in Arabic, I feel that it has a nicer essence, and ((I get a better understanding of the meanings)) than in English.
S26-C03-R26_030743-031756	Actually, it's been a while I haven't liked the .. the neither to listen to English songs nor read English books, now I listen to more English songs, but still, for English readings, ((I feel there's no spirit in it, I don't get any feelings from it)) .
S26-C03-R26_032043-032698	Yes, well, do you like listening to Arabic or English and can you tell us if you like listening to an particular singer??
S26-C03-R26_032778-032987	[HES] I prefer Arabic as well.
S26-C03-R26_032987-033171	I can listen to any singer.
S26-C03-R26_033171-033366	I have no problem with Arabic.
S26-C03-R26_033366-034208	For English also, if I like the song, it's fine, but actually I like songs by Taylor swift and I like her as a person and everything.
S26-C03-R26_034208-035062	[HES] For Arabic, no, ((just the normal)), I like most of the singers, I mean, there's no my favorite Arabic singer actually.
S26-C03-R26_035707-036060	[LAUGHTER] Okay I love The Student Cop.
S26-C03-R26_036240-036869	It's story [HES] is about a university that is supposed to be a corrupted university.
S26-C03-R26_037086-038427	And it's supposed that there is the .. the .. the officers actually want to appoint someone of the same age of the .. of the university students in order to %y .. to like, spy on them.
S26-C03-R26_039027-040119	And then they appointed him and they changed his appearance to no longer look like an officer and he makes friends with the suspected group and he gets close to them and finds out that they are actually ((kind)) .
S26-C03-R26_040119-040451	They were, yes, drug users, but not drug-traffickers.
S26-C03-R26_042135-042613	Yes, I joined a student activity since my second year of college.
S26-C03-R26_042854-044682	I was in the HR as an HR member, and then the year after I became a social media member and .. and in the middle of the year they made me a team leader in social media as well and .. and in my third year, I was the HR head and secretary of the club.
S26-C03-R26_044682-044957	[HES] And then I dropped the whole thing.
S26-C03-R26_044957-045120	What was the objective of the club?
S26-C03-R26_045120-046423	It was improving humanity through teaching them a lot of things about technology, about the .. I mean skills, soft skills or hard skills, actually anything.
S26-C03-R26_047665-047768	Dream job.
S26-C03-R26_047991-048187	I wish I can travel to space.
S26-C03-R26_048459-049199	Because [HES] I feel that it's something unknown.
S26-C03-R26_049199-051309	Actually, I want to go and see the .. what space looks like and .. and for example, how the earth and moon look like, and for example, I have always imagined actually that we .. we now live on Earth but we are .. I feel that I we are very deep, I mean, that there are layers above us .. I feel that we are inside Earth.
S26-C03-R26_051309-052677	But I imagine if I'm standing on the moon, I would .. I wouldn't feel the sky above me, I feel that I would be .. directly in space, so I want to imagine how this can happen, that I won't be on the moon then, but no, rather like that.
S26-C03-R26_052677-053231	And I mean, and I can see the stars closely, I don't know, I feel that I want to travel to space.
S26-C03-R26_054095-054350	Okay I have done two internships.
S26-C03-R26_054578-054987	It was in the data center department.
S26-C03-R26_054987-055689	They taught us a bit about networks and .. and database, for instance, how they save the information of the .. the bank.
S26-C03-R26_056596-057182	And most of the .. the internship was teaching actually, they were teaching us things, but nothing was required of us.
S26-C03-R26_057182-059364	The second internship was [HES] I was assisting in an android application %bt, I mean, the .. the .. the employees of the .. the company were using it for the managers to always keep track of whether an employee is working well or not, how much time he takes to be done.
S26-C03-R26_059364-060058	Well, this task is supposed to take a certain time, did he finish it in time or he lingered or did he finish it quickly and so on.
S26-C03-R26_060058-060343	So it's an application used by the employees of the company.
S26-C03-R26_061326-061877	[HES] I was just asking myself that same question recently, and I don't know.
S26-C03-R26_061877-062734	[HES] Everything has its advantages, but currently, as a TA, I feel a big responsibility.
S26-C03-R26_062734-064629	And .. and I feel that it requires much effort despite that I don't .. don't .. don't do as much as when I was a student, when I had a lot of deadlines and a lot of subjects to study and exams, but now I feel more exhausted, so, I don't know whether this is because of the responsibility or actually because I need to take a break after being a student, I don't know.
S26-C03-R26_064629-065032	But each one has its own advantages and I really can't decide which one is better.
S26-C03-R26_065397-066551	Yes, I traveled .. my first trip was to Saudi Arabia, we went on a pilgrimage, I was in six primary and then I traveled abroad two or three years ago.
S26-C03-R26_066551-067611	It was [HES] in Europe, we did a tour around several countries, we went to Italy and we went to Germany and Netherlands.
S26-C03-R26_067611-067822	And one day, we visited Switzerland and came back.
S26-C03-R26_067822-068054	[HES] It was really nice, honestly.
S26-C03-R26_068054-068546	And in summer .. last summer I traveled to USA, it was also very nice.
S26-C03-R26_068546-069272	And I wish to travel and live abroad, anywhere, I don't mind, but I wish to travel and live abroad, God willing.
S26-C03-R26_070290-071770	[HES] Okay Switzerland was very nice, even though we only stayed there for few hours, but the cleanliness and .. and people looked good and flowers were everywhere and .. it was really a very beautiful country.
S26-C03-R26_071770-073735	And in Holland, we went to a place like the .. the country side, actually their countryside, and the farms and the cows and .. and .. and we went to a farm selling ice cream made of their fresh milk and fruits and these things and I like nature in general and I like plants and I like the .. water and so.
S26-C03-R26_073735-074289	And .. and America, honestly, is all great, with no specific thing, all America is great.
S26-C03-R26_075931-076480	[HES] Okay.
S26-C03-R26_076663-078422	Okay I don't remember that there is a specific turning point in my life which had for instance a huge impact, but in general, I feel that my personality in school is totally different than my personality in college.
S26-C03-R26_078645-080970	I've become, actually at school I was sociable .. or not more sociable, but I used to befriend anyone and the .. actually there were many people in my life, but when I entered college, no, actually, I became no longer open with everyone.
S26-C03-R26_080970-081132	I have become more conservative.
S26-C03-R26_081946-082255	I used to like the individual project more.
S26-C03-R26_082255-083325	[HES] Because people at work %by .. have different personalities than .. than their normal personalities.
S26-C03-R26_083325-084816	And I have a problem that I don't trust .. anybody really or anybody's work, even if as a team we're supposed to distribute the tasks on us, I feel that, no, I'm not sure that he will do the work the way I want.
S26-C03-R26_084816-085144	And .. so I like doing all the work.
S26-C03-R26_086608-088670	[HES] It depends [HES] it depends on me, when I first see this person actually, some people I feel comfortable with immediately, so that's it, actually, and also my way of dealing with him is good, so he will feel comfortable talking to me and that's it, we get along together immediately.
S26-C03-R26_088670-089620	However, there are other people with whom I feel, no, I'm not comfortable. So, ((I will end it, I won't keep it going)), even if he wishes to, actually, ((I'm the one who isn't really willing to)) .
S26-C03-R26_090810-090903	No, not at all.
S26-C03-R26_090903-091707	[HES] normally no, I %b .. I accept any social level, I have no problem in the social level issue.
S26-C03-R26_091707-092734	But some people are in a very high social level to the extent that they themselves became arrogant. So, those people, I feel like I don't want to deal with them.
S26-C03-R26_092734-093740	Actually, that's it, actually I .. I have no problem in dealing with anybody in low social level, high social level, same social level, it makes no difference at all, but I feel annoyed from people who are arrogant due to their social level.
S26-C03-R26_094919-095478	That I forget if someone annoyed me [HES] .
S26-C03-R26_095478-095850	Initially, I have a problem in .. in my memory, actually.
S26-C03-R26_096006-096442	But honestly [HES] I don’t focus if someone did something annoyed me.
S26-C03-R26_096442-096696	I may get annoyed at the time and after a while, that's it, I overpass it.
S26-C03-R26_096696-097385	I don't keep saying he said so, he did so and so and .. no, that's it, I wish I would stay that way.
S26-C03-R26_097385-097880	I don't like quarrels and I don’t like problems, I don't like to ((hold grudges)) .
S26-C03-R26_099142-099448	[HES] Many things.
S26-C03-R26_099448-099617	Arrogance, as I said.
S26-C03-R26_099617-100650	To be the opposite of what I have just said about myself, to be (( a person who easily gets annoyed and focuses on details and not to be an easy going person and so on)) .
S26-C03-R26_100650-101799	[HES] or a person [HES] who acts stupid, I don't want to say that he is a person with low IQ level, no, but rather acting stupid.
S26-C03-R26_101799-103447	Meaning that he is ((close-minded)), no, I will not understand, when we try %n .. %n .. to negotiate and %n .. and ((to have a two-sided discussion)), no, I will not understand and I will not talk and that's it and anything.
S26-C03-R26_103447-103583	So, I don't like such stupidity.
S26-C03-R26_105420-107244	No, I can't do that, because if I don't understand I would feel irritated, I won't be able to speak normal English let alone advanced English words, so .. no, no I have never done that. For me, English is not the language I will use ((to escape)), on the contrary, I like Arabic more.
S26-C03-R26_107915-108082	I wish I could live without mobile phone.
S26-C03-R26_108082-108528	I wish I had been born in the period where there were no mobile phones or telephones or so.
S26-C03-R26_108528-109673	[HES] I can manage living without a mobile phone sometimes, I swear, sometimes I suddenly feel like "where is my mobile?" and I find out that I have it thrown somewhere and I'm not paying attention to it and I don't care.
S26-C03-R26_109673-110176	But at the same time, it has advantages.
S26-C03-R26_110176-110470	But no .. but yes, I can live without a mobile.
S26-C03-R26_112242-112457	To select a topic.
S26-C03-R26_112982-113662	Okay, I will convince you that summer is better than winter and more important than winter.
S26-C03-R26_113662-113739	Why?
S26-C03-R26_113739-114722	[HES] To start with, in winter we are all lazy and we want to stay in bed under the blanket and we don't want to move.
S26-C03-R26_114722-115945	[HES] Summer .. the .. winter %bey .. makes us hungry because we want to get warm and .. so we keep eating to burn food and get warm which is causes weight gain.
S26-C03-R26_115945-117414	[HES] Winter clothes makes people look fatter and most of winter clothes are dull because winter is gloomy in the first place and it's dark, and clouded and .. and it's windy and we get sick.
S26-C03-R26_117414-118444	And .. and .. and .. the rain .. the rain is we get wet and the glasses get messed up.
S26-C03-R26_118444-119297	And [LAUGHTER] .. and really, I don't like winter at all and when ((it's gloomy)), I don't like .. really I don't like it.
S26-C03-R26_119297-120282	In summer the sun is cheerful and flowers are blooming and they're colorful and birds are nice.
S26-C03-R26_120315-121817	The sky is blue and in summer there is summer vacation and we travel to the beach and we wear summer clothes that have nice colors, and are comfortable and look good.
S26-C03-R26_121817-122772	Everybody looks good in summer but in winter people are gloomy and .. and cold and wrapped up with clothes and look, no, actually, for me, summer is much better than winter.
S30-C03-R30_001088-001672	Okay I was in nun's school, it was both English and Français, ((both of them)), that's it.
S30-C03-R30_002044-002214	No, I was born here in Egypt.
S30-C03-R30_003632-003904	Okay I joined Engineering
S30-C03-R30_003904-004381	It’s a long story, first, I'm in a university in Germany called Amberg
S30-C03-R30_004381-004699	I applied for a scholarship there and got accepted
S30-C03-R30_004699-005625	But the point is that my grandpa was in his last days and he wanted us all to be around him so I I refused the scholarship to be with him and so.
S30-C03-R30_005625-005974	So I have already got the total degree of Ain shams credit section.
S30-C03-R30_005974-006517	So papy actually said, that's it, "you have done something good and so on, no you .. ((there's no need to go through a hard time and so)) ".
S30-C03-R30_006696-006974	That's it, that's why I chose Engineering actually.
S30-C03-R30_007690-007943	Okay Applied Arts, for instance, I'm not good at drawing.
S30-C03-R30_007972-008089	I don't like drawing at all.
S30-C03-R30_008089-008491	Actually, since I was at école, I was very good at Math and Physics and such things.
S30-C03-R30_008491-009332	And actually, I don't like memorizing, actually I like .. actually bring me something to think of and that's it, but don't ask me to memorize and and to do, no, %ma .. I can't stand that.
S30-C03-R30_009802-009946	That's .. that's against to my parents, in general.
S30-C03-R30_009946-010060	Okay
S30-C03-R30_010106-011219	It's either against .. I mean, mamy for example saw that in the école, I used to be exhausted and studied and so on, so she told me, no my daughter, you should enroll in Management or anything, be relaxed, I mean she is not .. initially against Engineering.
S30-C03-R30_011219-011743	And papy, actually in our family they tell me their opinion and I should do whatever suits me, so they let me enroll in Engineering.
S30-C03-R30_012763-013096	There are two things actually, I either want MET or Mechatronics.
S30-C03-R30_013096-013758	But what will push me away from Mechatronics is that it's actually known to be very hard and not many girls join it, so, I still don't know.
S30-C03-R30_013758-014148	In general, there aren't many girls in Engineering, actually [LAUGHTER] .
S30-C03-R30_014858-015142	I like Mechatronics, I like what they do.
S30-C03-R30_015142-015341	MET, I like CS, that's it.
S30-C03-R30_016838-017516	If I become a TA, I will complete my Masters, and if I don't become a not a TA, I will work first and then I will do my Masters.
S30-C03-R30_018215-018367	Now or before?
S30-C03-R30_018517-019703	Before entering college, I used to train every morning from five to seven, and then I go to the école and then I come back from the école, %b .. I go to another training, and then when I come back, I study.
S30-C03-R30_020379-021376	Okay, for me, the most important thing, which we consider holy, is family, I mean, you have to be in the family gathering and then do whatever you want, so usually I sit with my family and then I go to play volleyball.
S30-C03-R30_021640-021767	Yes, very much.
S30-C03-R30_024160-025062	In general, I like reading novels, actually, the most two novels I like are Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte and The Alchemist, these are my favorite two.
S30-C03-R30_025062-025183	Quotes, honestly, I don't remember.
S30-C03-R30_025814-026322	People living in Yorkshire and the Moors, and they are in love with each other and problems and such things, that's it.
S30-C03-R30_026572-026757	Yes
S30-C03-R30_027003-027222	It depends on my mood actually, %ma ..
S30-C03-R30_027781-027918	I like Amr Diab.
S30-C03-R30_029003-029428	[HES] Yes, there is a movie called Bird box, this is very good.
S30-C03-R30_029428-030446	It is a disease that is transmitted to other people by eye contact, so, all of them put bandages on .. actually on their eyes to protect themselves from this disease so as not to be infected.
S30-C03-R30_031606-031881	For me, I will enroll them in a nun's school.
S30-C03-R30_031881-032277	Because when I actually joined the university here, the most people ..
S30-C03-R30_032277-032467	Actually, I appreciated my school was when I came here.
S30-C03-R30_032467-032617	Actually, I felt that we were really brought up well.
S30-C03-R30_032617-033025	There are some people when you see you wonder, what are you doing? what are you doing?
S30-C03-R30_033025-033306	So, honestly, I don't want them to be like those people.
S30-C03-R30_033725-034052	In Siemens.
S30-C03-R30_034052-034252	I wish to work in Siemens so much.
S30-C03-R30_034252-034353	Why? I mean ..
S30-C03-R30_034421-034754	No it's .. no I don’t know ((which job I shall do)) .
S30-C03-R30_036293-036374	Yes, that I code.
S30-C03-R30_036430-036529	That I code, actually.
S30-C03-R30_037634-038409	I was in the scout at school and .. and sometimes I go to Resala, Cairo Runners and such things I mean.
S30-C03-R30_038847-039162	Okay, in Cairo Runners, I used to organize the marathon itself.
S30-C03-R30_039162-039685	In Resala, we help people, %bn .. actually we used to collect clothes and such stuff and distribute them.
S30-C03-R30_039685-040065	In the Scout, I reached cheft .. cheftaine rank.
S30-C03-R30_040065-040145	Okay.
S30-C03-R30_040821-041081	Yes, yes, actually, I was responsible of a group.
S30-C03-R30_042930-043623	I like both of them, actually %ma .. I don't like to have so much free time, actually ((having both of them)) is good for me.
S30-C03-R30_044951-046344	There .. there will be more responsibility but the point is I joined .. I mean why did I join university? To be qualified to join a better place, or to do something, but to live my whole life in the university, I mean I will never grow.
S30-C03-R30_046751-046887	No.
S30-C03-R30_047411-047546	Germany.
S30-C03-R30_047546-048365	I .. I actually wish to visit Amberg very much, Amberg is a city which is divided into two parts, one part is the university and the other part is Siemens.
S30-C03-R30_048365-049192	And most of the people working at the university do internships and things in Siemens, so I liked it very much actually, this is the most thing I wish for.
S30-C03-R30_050138-050838	I like Dahab because it's a quiet place. Actually, I .. actually I like tranquility, meditation and so on I mean.
S30-C03-R30_052578-053924	If it's forever, I think that would be hard, because anyone from my family .. actually we, for example, we are a very close family. Anyone who travels and doesn't return, and that's it, becomes forgotten, that's it, he traveled and doesn't return.
S30-C03-R30_053924-054549	So I don't feel that I can leave them, but I can ((come and go)), but to live abroad my whole life, I don't feel that I will be able to do that.
S30-C03-R30_055788-056557	No, in that case, it's okay, but I won't immigrate, or I mean, I won't live there forever, everything was in Egypt, no.
S30-C03-R30_058337-059363	Look, my role model in this respect is my father, actually my father .. there are many people he is in high position, many people ask him to work abroad, he travels a lot.
S30-C03-R30_059363-059712	He doesn't accept because he wants to stay here and our family to stay together.
S30-C03-R30_059712-060244	So, I look up to him, since he did that, I will do the same, honestly, I won't %h .. won't stay there.
S30-C03-R30_060244-061073	Well, can you tell me about a moment in your life that you felt is a turning point?
S30-C03-R30_061073-062527	The issue is a bit, I %d .. I entered general secondary, okay? I then gained weight in an abnormal way, then papy told me no there is something abnormal .. actually there must be something .. I went for an examination and I found out that I had thyroid gland.
S30-C03-R30_062527-062718	So, I got very upset for a reason.
S30-C03-R30_062718-063273	I play in el Ahly club, I have been playing volley for thirteen years, my position is very important.
S30-C03-R30_063273-064344	My fitness and everything .. everything, actually, was great and I was happy actually. So, of course, later on I can't resume playing as before and also there is nothing I can do.
S30-C03-R30_064344-064613	So, at the beginning ((I hated myself)) .
S30-C03-R30_064613-065281	I mean and even in the the first week in the university I didn't go. I can't wear my clothes, I can't do anything.
S30-C03-R30_065281-065812	And after that, actually, that is, I'm trying to accept myself, so that's it, this is the most prominent thing.
S30-C03-R30_066548-067101	In groups because I like getting to know many people actually, I don't like being alone.
S30-C03-R30_069189-069867	No, I feel that it's okay actually, we can .. can arrange things normally among us, we did many tasks in groups and it was fine.
S30-C03-R30_070608-070789	Liked or respected?
S30-C03-R30_070934-071054	No respected.
S30-C03-R30_071232-071475	I will refer also to the same point, which is my school.
S30-C03-R30_071475-072199	Actually, we have been brought up like that, that the most important thing actually is to be respected and to respect others and so on. However, being liked is not an issue at all.
S30-C03-R30_073682-073926	My father, actually, my father, in everything.
S30-C03-R30_075240-075783	No, very much, In general, actually, I'm always very talkative with people, that is I'm a very sociable person.
S30-C03-R30_076274-076525	Yes, ((it negatively impacts me)) at the end.
S30-C03-R30_076525-077273	That is true, actually semester one actually in which I get to know many people and some of them I shouldn't have known them but I get to know them as well so ..
S30-C03-R30_077273-078566	But, I'm not upset, actually, even if I knew bad people, it's okay, I gained experience and I won't do that again, I knew that this person is .. this person is for example, we shouldn't ((welcome him in our life much)), ((I should keep him at distance)), so, I don't feel that that is bad actually.
S30-C03-R30_079331-080566	No, not at all, I mean I I'm being myself and whoever doesn't like that, no problem, actually, I ((like actually to be myself)), whoever believes that this is something not good for him, that's it, no problem.
S30-C03-R30_081195-081283	I will not do that.
S30-C03-R30_081413-082339	No, I won't do that, actually I deal with everybody in a way .. I don't want to embarrass the other person, actually, if someone is good I will deal with him in a good way, if .. I will not embarrass anyone actually, that's it.
S30-C03-R30_082937-083221	Trait? [LAUGHTER]
S30-C03-R30_083221-083754	It might be that I'm sociable, but this .. actually it can be a good and a bad trait as I said before, but I like it actually.
S30-C03-R30_084470-085596	Okay, I accept everything, but I mean if someone for example doesn't respect me, someone overpasses his limits, this is it, no, but, anything else, it's okay %ma ..
S30-C03-R30_086507-086932	That I'm not able to achieve a goal I have in .. in mind.
S30-C03-R30_086932-087478	Actually, everything that I can't achieve, I go crazy, how come I can't achieve that. No, I will achieve it, that's it actually.
S30-C03-R30_088254-088907	It is my mother, honestly, who helps me to do that, that is, ((there is no problem)) and everything will be okay, and you are doing something .. that's it actually.
S30-C03-R30_090735-092595	Yes, [HES] once I was ushering in something like a fair, it was affiliated to Siemens as well, so they were asking me about something I really didn't understand anything about, and the person who assigned me actually he trusted me, so, I kept talking to them in Français, so they said this girl is actually they didn't understand anything and that's it [LAUGHTER] .
S30-C03-R30_092814-093011	I hate the mobile phone in the first place.
S30-C03-R30_093011-093722	Actually, till last year I had an ordinary mobile phone not a smart phone, my father is the one who told me ((no, what is this device you are using)), so he got me this one.
S30-C03-R30_093722-094821	Because it really brings people apart, actually, for me, if I want to talk to someone, I will talk to him over the phone or I will meet him. But, that we text and we are supposed to have asked about one another that way, I don't consider it something nice actually.
S30-C03-R30_096076-097945	Okay initially I .. what I want to convince you with, hold on, your family are here for some time and they will go, and this is .. this is a fact, I mean, no need to .. actually if you didn't spend time with them and felt .. and really loved them, you will regret it afterwards, you will appreciate them, that's it.
S32-C03-R32_001919-002682	And we took languages, first language English, and second language French, that's all.
S32-C03-R32_003907-005668	Okay, it was supposed to, from the very start, before joining the university, I wanted to initially enroll in Business, so I was fighting a lot with my father, I actually got ninety percent in general secondary, so, I wanted to enroll in Business or Commerce or anything related to Entrepreneurship and Economics and such things.
S32-C03-R32_005668-006814	But, my father refused so I was trying a lot, but he refused so I thought .. actually to do what my father and mother want, so .. and thought of joining Engineering and try to balance between both.
S32-C03-R32_006814-007297	And, in all cases, when I graduate, I can work in Business as I wish, that's it.
S32-C03-R32_007297-008718	I joined the university, in the first semester, I succeeded in four subjects and failed in one [LAUGHTER], then in the second semester, I succeeded in two subjects and failed in three, so, I told him no %ma [LAUGHTER] .. I will not continue, that's it, so I said .. and at that time I was balancing between business and so on.
S32-C03-R32_008718-009274	So, I figured that Engineering is not easy to the extent that I can study two disciplines at the same time, so I was exhausted.
S32-C03-R32_009274-011456	Yes, when I newly joined the university, in that first semester, I thought that I actually if .. actually if I studied a lot by myself I will reach nothing so I searched for student activity related to %b .. to entrepreneurship, I found some student activity, I joined it and I was .. I was the youngest one there and there wasn't actually .. there was no one else my age, all of them were older than me, I was the youngest person to get accepted.
S32-C03-R32_011456-012010	And after the first year I received .. I received the Best Member and Business Developer titles.
S32-C03-R32_012084-012538	And afterwards, I fought with my father, but he didn't agree.
S32-C03-R32_012538-014187	I was supposed to try to %a .. ((to get things done)) and I didn't tell him about the subjects I failed in and I was trying to save money to take summer courses for these subjects, to graduate early as well, so as not to afford him more money or .. and not to inform him as well so as not to feel guilty.
S32-C03-R32_014239-015532	That's all, so honestly, ((I failed in many subjects)), by the summer courses, I joined the first summer course, I saved money and joined the first summer course and then in the next year we took like ten subjects, I succeeded in five and failed in five, so that's it actually, ((things are messed up)) .
S32-C03-R32_015532-016539	So I became probation and the university sent to him and told him everything so at that time I was actually extremely depressed and I tried to commit suicide and it was a hard night.
S32-C03-R32_016539-016774	Yes, I swear, things were really messed up.
S32-C03-R32_016805-018386	I had been for two years hiding things from my parents and taking it as a burden on me and .. and I'm taking the responsibility and .. and trying .. I was trying to study, actually I was even trying to work hard because I want to graduate because I know exactly what I want after graduation, I mean, I want to work in business and I know exactly what I want.
S32-C03-R32_018386-019405	So I was trying to get things done actually .. and I don't know, I couldn't give more actually, I have no idea whether I was stupid or what, but I don't .. don't .. don't know what to do, honestly, so I went on and ((pushed myself)) a while.
S32-C03-R32_019405-019666	[HES] I finished the second year after he was informed.
S32-C03-R32_019666-020544	I told him I don't want to continue, so he told me I forgave you [LAUGHTER] after I knew and I will give you another chance to continue, so I told him that I didn't want to continue [LAUGHTER] .
S32-C03-R32_020544-020885	So, he .. he took a point against me which is that I was hiding that from him.
S32-C03-R32_020885-021731	So, I tried hard in the third year, I got out of the probation and things were fine but there was a subject that ((was hard for me)) .
S32-C03-R32_021731-021883	, The system ((was not working)) in it.
S32-C03-R32_021883-022154	So ((I failed)), I became three point seven one.
S32-C03-R32_022154-022326	So, the university sent to me.
S32-C03-R32_022326-024018	So I traveled, I was initially in Minia, and then I came with my father to see what is the problem so the .. the .. he met the probation office, they kept telling him about the system and that if one wants to oblige you to be transferred he would have failed in all subjects but I succeed in half of them, and fail the others.
S32-C03-R32_024018-024874	And they kept saying .. they kept saying actually do you want to see your son an engineer and that it? An unsuccessful Engineer? or to see him successful in what he likes and ((such talk))?
S32-C03-R32_024874-025236	He told them I want him an unsuccessful engineer [LAUGHTER]
S32-C03-R32_025236-025639	Then after going home he asked me do you want to transfer? I told him yes I want to transfer.
S32-C03-R32_025639-026666	So he told me, well, you will try again with the university and if .. the university wanted me .. it is supposed that they wanted me to transfer, if it didn't work with the university, I will go with mum, if it didn’t work with the university, I will claim a transfer request.
S32-C03-R32_026666-028058	Honestly, I kept thinking of .. thinking of the decision and its consequences and to be way behind my class and that I .. so many things honestly, but at the same time, the benefits which is that .. that it's my dream, I mean, it's my passion, that's it, I can't believe it ((initially)) .
S32-C03-R32_028058-028455	Actually, I have been three years in a nightmare and everything is dark for me, that's it.
S32-C03-R32_028455-029064	So, I felt like that's it, I .. that is, how come I'll actually be in Management? I can't believe it actually, it's like, what? [LAUGHTER]
S32-C03-R32_029064-030048	So I brought my mum to help me to go to the .. the coordinator of Engineering, she fixed the system issue for me and I normally get out of the probation and I will proceed in Engineering.
S32-C03-R32_030048-030624	He was trying to search for an intermediary so we .. that I go back to Engineering despite that I was already back.
S32-C03-R32_030624-032326	That's it, so mum sat with the coordinator again, so she kept telling her .. she kept convincing her that he .. she told her that he is doing well in subjects that are not related to CS, and ((he does well)), and he wanted me to be in MET in particular not only Engineering.
S32-C03-R32_032326-033024	I was already in CS that is %ma .. I'm not into CS at all nor in coding, so that is, you placed me in a part in Engineering, no, that is impossible for me.
S32-C03-R32_033024-033771	Actually, if it was Mechatronics and, yes, I had taken it in general secondary, I was clever and understood it a bit, yes, ((I would have managed)), but, that CS %ma .. it's impossible, for me, no way.
S32-C03-R32_033771-034100	So the coordinator kept convincing mum a lot, a lot, a lot.
S32-C03-R32_034100-034522	And then mum got out and she kept scolding me and ..
S32-C03-R32_034749-034979	And all my friend will graduate before me.
S32-C03-R32_035277-035519	Despite, that I have been there three years for their own sake not mine.
S32-C03-R32_035519-035981	Actually, it is not that I found it hard so I transferred, no, I wanted it from the very beginning.
S32-C03-R32_035981-036113	That's it, so I was then transferred.
S32-C03-R32_036736-037062	That's it, so I submitted a transfer request and I got transferred.
S32-C03-R32_037062-037214	And my dad kept making me feel guilty of course.
S32-C03-R32_037214-037739	Saying would you be doing well in this discipline or that you are actually a stupid person and you won't succeed in any discipline.
S32-C03-R32_037739-037863	So, I thought.
S32-C03-R32_037863-038479	At that time, I doubted myself, I told him I have no idea honestly but I will try actually .. I mean give me a chance.
S32-C03-R32_040037-041515	[HES] I wake up early everyday whether I have ((classes)) or not, I read a book for a while then I study then I go to the university, if I have ((classes)), I attend tutorials, then I come back again, sleep for a while, wake up to study and that's it.
S32-C03-R32_041515-043047	Or [HES] doing the same things but at night after coming back I study for a while and go out, I go to mid town, I go to Masr el gedida, I like going out and taking photos, going for a stroll, visiting galleries and so on.
S32-C03-R32_043500-044364	I swear I don't notice the weekend in the first place, because I take overload, so I stay and study, so it doesn't matter, no, all days are the same, whether vacation or not, so I wake up doing the same routine actually.
S32-C03-R32_045951-046102	I like reading novels.
S32-C03-R32_046102-046627	Currently I'm reading a book, I have just finished it, it's called the forty rules of love.

S32-C03-R32_047413-047818	This is the best book I have ever read in my whole life, it's a novel, the best novel I have read in my life, honestly.
S32-C03-R32_048258-048659	I am football fan but my weight wouldn't allow me to practice anything [LAUGHTER] .

S32-C03-R32_050006-050424	I went to concerts to listen to music, concerts, for example, opera, such things.
S32-C03-R32_051324-052613	[HES] it's .. it's, actually, the last movie I have watched has impacted me, but not the most, actually, the most one which affected was A Beautiful Mind, it was actually produced in the year two thousand and one, and the last one was South Paw.
S32-C03-R32_052613-052831	That was a nice movie.
S32-C03-R32_052831-053903	So supposedly he was a boxer and his wife was supporting him and so on and he was .. he was the strongest boxer in the world and he used to achieve incredible records.
S32-C03-R32_053903-054281	Then, he was fighting in the .. with his competitor ..

S32-C03-R32_057921-058746	[HES] honestly I don't know what to say but .. I have to work .. it must be a company that I have worked with.
S32-C03-R32_058746-059143	No, no, actually, I gained experience from my practical life in general.
S32-C03-R32_059143-059762	I did two events art exhibition and I used to keep preparing for them for two months and I not sleeping ((at all)) .
S32-C03-R32_059762-060484	It was around .. it was on the eighth of February, so ((it wasn't a long time ago)), I had been preparing for it for two or three months.
S32-C03-R32_060484-061792	And I was .. actually I had a team .. I had with me .. we were six, but actually the experience, I I used to not sleep until I got things done and I was .. I had it in Minia because in Minia they don't care about art and I wanted something to support.
S32-C03-R32_061792-062653	So .. so I was .. actually I was happy with myself at the end because ((I worked really hard)), actually ((I didn't care whether)) a lot of people will come or not, no, because I believed that I exerted a great effort.
S32-C03-R32_062653-063642	Regardless, that I was pushing them all to work, they were not motivated, but I was happy that I %b .. was trying till the end, even if I was desperate and felt that ((things will not go well)) but.
S32-C03-R32_064640-064941	No, of course practical life actually, honestly I mean, for many reasons.
S32-C03-R32_064941-067021	I think while being a student, it would be very difficult to be financially independent and honestly I want to be independent and at the same time, at work, I can take the risk at my will, I can do that, but .. but if I start doing anything %ha .. that I will do incorrectly at the university as a student, my parents are taking responsibility for me, but in the .. in the working life, I'm fully responsible for myself, that's it.
S32-C03-R32_067372-067624	No, abroad, no.
S32-C03-R32_067982-068178	[HES] New York.
S32-C03-R32_068618-068901	No [LAUGHTER] but the .. actually the ..
S32-C03-R32_068901-070294	From the photographs I see, I wish I could take photos there in a crazy way and people there as well, when I see the photos, I feel happy and at the same time the .. the business life there as in economics also is very robust so .. so everything is gathered there.
S32-C03-R32_071030-071399	Yes, I traveled once to Black And White Desert by coincidence.
S32-C03-R32_071399-071806	Actually, I was .. was going home in the fifth settlement, I found myself in Black And White Desert [LAUGHTER] .
S32-C03-R32_071806-072161	I was very tired and one of my friends told me I will give you a ride on my way.
S32-C03-R32_072234-072503	I didn't know that ((she's heading to)) October, not the fifth settlement in the first place ..
S32-C03-R32_072503-073479	So, when I first took the bus I slept and when I woke up I found myself in the desert already, and I was wearing short, t-shirt, and Crocs, I had nothing but my mobile so .. so I was surprised.
S32-C03-R32_073479-074615	One of our friends there had a camera and it was originally a trip related to foreigners and related to AIESEC and so, so I kept taking a lot of photos and they were honestly the best photos I have ever taken in my life so .. so I will never forget it actually.
S32-C03-R32_075301-075574	Yes, of course when I tried.
S32-C03-R32_076167-076560	That I became optimistic actually, I used to see everything dark.
S32-C03-R32_076666-077545	I don’t know when I will graduate from engineering because I can't pass the subjects, so .. but for now I have become .. yes, now I am aware, I %hat .. ((I took the first steps)) and ((I know how to proceed)), that's it.
S32-C03-R32_078187-079193	And, I swear, it's supposed to be that, actually, working in teams is definitely easier, but I work alone because I don’t find anybody to work with me, I don’t know anyone in these classes, so I work alone and I get the work done and I don’t sleep, but working in teams is easier actually.
S32-C03-R32_080356-081259	I used to say this honestly at first and then I .. I don’t like anyone to get grades ((based on my efforts)), honestly, so I finish the whole project on my own, and to fully understand and be sure of it.
S32-C03-R32_081259-081816	But I let him be responsible for a part I have already done just so ((he would have participated)), but I didn't inform him that he did it, so that he ((would have participated)) .
S32-C03-R32_081863-082052	But if I am not able to do something .. actually if the project
S32-C03-R32_082052-083601	Huge, definitely, I can't do it alone, I mean if the project is big, I can't do it alone, so surely, I will need help, and at the end, after he finishes his part, I check it so that I can see that he, yes, he .. I agree that he did it correctly or do I just think that there is something to be edited?
S32-C03-R32_084302-084686	[LAUGHTER] I don't know, I don't think so, honestly.
S32-C03-R32_084686-085029	I can't find .. I can't find anyone, actually, I can't ..
S32-C03-R32_085029-085163	Maybe my uncle, for example.

S32-C03-R32_085837-086191	He has been working for fifty years, he really doesn't sleep.
S32-C03-R32_086191-086668	It means whether he travels to attend conferences abroad, to present something, he has traveled all over the world.
S32-C03-R32_086668-086929	He is one of the best people in the world in .. in his field.

S32-C03-R32_087764-087961	To the extent that he doesn't see now.
S32-C03-R32_087961-088834	I mean he completely lost his sight, he can actually see when .. I need to support him to walk, but he still works normally, and he goes to work every day even on Friday, normally, no problem.
S32-C03-R32_089392-089563	No, to be respected, honestly.
S32-C03-R32_089605-090584	Because being liked life goes on actually, and whoever will like me now might not like me tomorrow, actually, it doesn't matter, what is important is respect, which lasts forever, actually.
S32-C03-R32_091302-092480	No, it's very easy, honestly, I mean I feel that people, no, actually why not? why not? I'm, socially, a bit, actually, lately I started to ((get less involved)) because I don’t have energy honestly, but, no, in general, no, actually, why so?

S32-C03-R32_093820-094030	No, no, no, I deal with all people in the same way.
S32-C03-R32_095364-095714	I have a goal, that's all [LAUGHTER] .

S32-C03-R32_098968-099874	I mean, I have phobia of exams and I don’t know why, actually, I have studied everything but I actually feel that I might not get a good grade, and if I got a low grade, ((it will be a problem)) so ..
S32-C03-R32_100870-101019	No [LAUGHTER] .
S32-C03-R32_101019-102028	Maybe once in an interview, honestly., he was asking me a question in English and I did not understand it, but I kept talking about something else, and he got distracted and forgot the question, he was happy, I don’t actually know why [LAUGHTER] .
S32-C03-R32_102397-102865	Yes, I can, no problem, live without a mobile because I like reading and I like watching television.

S32-C03-R32_105570-105977	[HES] Are you convinced that artists earn a lot of money?
S32-C03-R32_106052-106320	How does a painter earn money?
S32-C03-R32_107349-107678	So, do you think that this painting is easily sold so where would he sell it, for example?
S32-C03-R32_107871-108261	There are many students at the faculty of fine arts, ((many)) .
S32-C03-R32_108699-109830	There is a website that is supposed to connect artists with people who are very interested, and there are a lot of such people on this website.
S32-C03-R32_109830-110262	I don’t know whether it was done or not, honestly, but I wanted to do it in the project in the previous semester.
S32-C03-R32_110262-110952	So .. so no it was implemented .. implemented and .. and most of the .. the artists gained a lot of money.
S32-C03-R32_110952-111220	And it encouraged students to join the faculty of fine arts.
S33-C03-R33_001221-001719	I was born in Cairo, in El Manial.
S33-C03-R33_001719-002276	I was in a [HES] languages school actually.
S33-C03-R33_002276-003263	I was in a national school until I reached third preparatory, then starting from first secondary, I entered IG.
S33-C03-R33_004497-005776	I joined computer engineering, from the very beginning, before joining the university, I was .. I was planning actually to join Computer Science such as programming and so on.
S33-C03-R33_005776-006817	It was the .. the .. the .. actually the plan was like that from the beginning, and when I entered, I liked the topic more, so actually I found myself in it.
S33-C03-R33_007745-008191	We [COUGH] there are several fields, %bn .. we we learn about.
S33-C03-R33_008191-008668	[HES] Things related to software and things related to hardware.
S33-C03-R33_008668-009661	[HES] Different things, I mean, very basics things of things %ma .. we don't use it .. no one uses them at the moment, but we have to know.
S33-C03-R33_009661-010828	[HES] Actually, the .. the .. the .. our field is wide, it has .. it has several .. several branches, actually, we take hints from each one of them.
S33-C03-R33_011312-012311	I'm developing an augmented reality application that is supposed to enhance the teaching process of algorithms, this is actually related to computer science.
S33-C03-R33_012311-014002	There are algorithms .. algorithms that are hard to be understood or actually the .. the student to grasp it well, so for me, the project is an augmented reality application that facilitates the visualization of how these algorithms work and so, so that the issue would be easier actually.
S33-C03-R33_014002-014177	It is more of enhancing education.
S33-C03-R33_015189-015890	During the bachelor project period, my day goes by routine, I do not go to the university except for almost one or two days a week.
S33-C03-R33_015890-017839	I get up in the morning %b .. I actually have breakfast and so, and then if I have a some tasks to do in the bachelor project, I work on it and if I don’t, I can do anything else, I may talk to one of my friends, hang out, [HES] I can do some research for my project to enhance it, something like that.
S33-C03-R33_018620-019971	I actually go out with my friends, I go to church on Friday, [HES] I take a walk, I can go to the gym, and so on, that's it.

S33-C03-R33_024176-026179	For me, music depends on my mood, I mean, sometimes I want things that are energetic %t .. %t .. %t .. to wake me up, sometimes I want something soft %t .. deep for instance %t .. %t .. to be, relaxing, meditation, and so on.
S33-C03-R33_026453-027790	Both of them, I actually listen to anything, actually, I listen to any kind of music, I listen to Arabic, I listen to local songs, I listen to English, Jazz, Hip Hop, Rap, I listen to everything.
S33-C03-R33_028548-029019	There are standards actually but I don’t have a specific quote on my mind now.
S33-C03-R33_029599-030433	I got bored quickly so for me movies are actually .. unless I go to the cinema, I can watch a movie till the end, but other than that, I have never watched a movie till the end.

S33-C03-R33_032536-033470	I felt that it changed me, changed many things in me, So, enrolling my children in IG is very important to me, and for sure that would be in a reputable school.
S33-C03-R33_034351-035690	I wish to work in a big corporate, a big company, for a period .. a certain period, and after that, if ((things go well)) I wish to do a start-up actually.
S33-C03-R33_036477-038143	Yes, I did two internships, one in the summer of 2017, two thousand seventeen, it was for one month, but I didn't benefit much from it, I used to just go and do nothing, because the department I joined in the internship was still new, so there weren't any tasks to do.
S33-C03-R33_038143-039522	The following summer I attended another internship, this was really great, we actually worked in it and learned many things and got to know people, it was two months, so, actually it was a nice experience.
S33-C03-R33_040517-041081	I mean, look, there is .. I mean, this has its own advantages and that has its own advantages, and this has its own disadvantages and that has its own disadvantages.
S33-C03-R33_041081-042404	But, I feel that my life during the .. the working life will be better than university life actually, because I live away from university so this university trip back and forth every day, in traffic, wastes a lot of my time.
S33-C03-R33_042404-043209	I might still work at a place that is faraway, but I feel that, during college, a lot of time is wasted.
S33-C03-R33_043486-043605	No, I haven't traveled.
S33-C03-R33_044247-044950	I wish to take a tour in Europe, I mean I feel that if I didn't do this during university years, I won't be able to do this afterwards.
S33-C03-R33_044950-045672	[HES] there are .. there are many places I want to go in Europe, I want to make a Europe tour, that is a euro tour.
S33-C03-R33_047134-047965	Yes, of course, this will be a very good opportunity and actually I don’t know what will affect my decision at that time, but it might be the duration.
S33-C03-R33_047965-048561	If it is a very long period, and I don’t know ((how things will go there)), I might hesitate a little
S33-C03-R33_048561-049387	Actually .. actually I hope to have a simple experience at first, it won't be very tense actually.
S33-C03-R33_050193-050640	No, %ma .. I haven't been there yet, so I don't know, but why, why this in particular?
S33-C03-R33_051294-052427	No, actually I don't know what the lifestyle abroad looks like, I haven't ((been around)), so, I don't know, actually when .. when I go and see it, then I can make such decision.
S33-C03-R33_053326-053762	Actually, as I have said before, the period of IG was also a turning point in my life.
S33-C03-R33_053762-054469	Actually, if I hadn't entered IG, I don't think I would have wanted to join computer science.
S33-C03-R33_054469-056464	I wasn't used to work that is .. that is tough, I mean, that is hard working, so I see that actually IG was a turning point, and also that I joined computer science here at my university, this also was a turning point because I felt that I developed a lot during this time.
S33-C03-R33_057188-057679	It's all about the .. hard working .. a little bit hard working.
S33-C03-R33_057679-058164	It wasn't really there from the beginning but when I joined university I was obliged to do it.
S33-C03-R33_058164-059024	So unwillingly, actually, %akt .. I mean I gained the .. this feature in my personality.
S33-C03-R33_059024-059800	Perseverance too, ((I keep trying a lot)), I don't lose hope easily, I didn't have this trait either.
S33-C03-R33_059800-061033	[HES] Ambition as well, actually, throughout my life, ((my ambition was limited)) .. ((only for the near future)) but after I joined university, I started to ((have long-term ambitions)) and so.
S33-C03-R33_061704-061950	No, I prefer working alone.
S33-C03-R33_061950-063022	Actually, for me, the idea of team work, is not .. [COUGH] actually it is a point of weakness, and I'm aware of that, and actually, I am trying that I get over it but this hasn't happened yet.
S33-C03-R33_063868-065048	It .. actually, it was in the past, when I was young, of course when one is young, one has many role models, that is, I want to be like that person ((and so on)), but currently, no, there are none.
S33-C03-R33_065835-066002	Respected.
S33-C03-R33_066002-067339	Because this is the nature of my personality, I feel that I value respect rather than love, for me, it is not .. it is not necessary that all people love me, but it is necessary, for me, that all people respect me.
S33-C03-R33_068516-069272	I am .. I am a very easy-going person, but I am not initiative, so some people think that it is not easy for them to talk to me but I am not like that.
S33-C03-R33_069272-070799	They might take this first impression about me, because as I said, I am not initiative, so they believe I am ((cold)) or so or not friendly but if someone ((took the first step with me)), he will find that it's very easy to talk to me.
S33-C03-R33_071829-072329	No, actually, I feel that I can talk to ((everyone according to own way)) .
S33-C03-R33_072329-072873	So what do you need to do if you're talking to people of lower social level?
S33-C03-R33_072873-074300	I notice that I %bt .. I mean if there is .. ((there are certain words that I think about before saying)), for example, if I am talking and .. there's a specific word that they won't understand, I will think of an alternative.
S33-C03-R33_074300-074833	I will see their way of speaking and will try to cope with it, actually.
S33-C03-R33_075432-076311	[HES] It's kind of a tricky question.
S33-C03-R33_076311-076899	It could be the .. the will power actually.
S33-C03-R33_076899-078433	I mean, I feel that the .. my will power wasn't strong before and has begun to become strong, so I want to keep that and keep it strong always and not to be weakened .. not to be weakened again.
S33-C03-R33_079676-080057	Lying .. lying and ((fabricating stories)), are the ((most traits that could kept me away from anyone)) .
S33-C03-R33_080790-082121	No, absolutely not, as long as my family sees that I am not doing anything wrong, they leave me do whatever I want, %ma .. %ma .. they don't try to change anything in me, as long as I am not doing anything wrong, as long as I'm doing .. doing well.
S33-C03-R33_082918-083702	Mainly during college we I feel that we have many deadlines and I feel that I don't know where to start or ((where to begin)) or what to do.
S33-C03-R33_083702-084607	The .. I mean, for me, it's disorganization and when I have a lot to do, this makes feel stressed and I don't know what to do.
S33-C03-R33_085161-086398	Actually, usually, one of my friends is known to be organized, he is the most organized among us, ((so we turn to him actually)), ((we take his advice on how to manage our time)), meaning what should we start with and he actually %bey .. %bey .. %bey .. suggests some ((tips)) for us.
S33-C03-R33_086398-086987	That now we should do this because it's important, and after that, we can ((work on that)) and so on.
S33-C03-R33_088521-089748	I haven't been in the situation of interviews before, I did two internships as I a said before, but both of them were ((so)) I mean, I didn't have any interviews for them, I was just accepted.
S33-C03-R33_089748-091475	It might be that if someone is trying to ((show superiority over me)), so ((I might show him superiority)), but to talk in English ((show off)), no but if someone is showing off, I ((will show superiority)), do you get it? that's it.
S33-C03-R33_092083-094055	No, definitely, for me, I do everything using the mobile phone, I mean if I am sitting anywhere and I decide to do anything, I can do it, I can call someone, look for something on the internet, search, take a photo of something I liked, send something to somebody, no, nowadays, the mobile is something [HES] that is actually essential in human's life.
S33-C03-R33_094460-096568	Definitely, when somebody lives .. for example, once my mobile wasn't working and it was being fixed, I felt that we waste so much time of the day on the mobile, I felt that the day really was .. without the mobile, was very fruitful, [HES], actually it had .. it was a productive day, unlike the day when I am using the mobile, one wastes so much time on it without being aware.
S33-C03-R33_097778-100224	[HES] I actually encourage any undergrad to complete the masters because this will really strengthen his CV, it will give him an edge over other people that .. that are that are of his age and his peers, some people may be lazy to do so, saying that we studied for five years in engineering and I won't spend wo years in masters and so on, but actually you will thank yourself later for that, actually.
S35-C03-R35_001238-001481	Okay, I'm from Alexandria.
S35-C03-R35_001481-002474	I was in a national school, I used to take .. the languages that I used to take .. I used to learn English and Arabic and Deutsch and French before it, but I changed this in the last three years.
S35-C03-R35_003451-004105	Okay, I was originally going to join electromechanics in Alexandria, ((but I fell short on two marks)) .
S35-C03-R35_004105-004827	So I applied here at the GUC and that was .. and I chose mechatronics before joining, because it resembles the other one, but it turned out better, honestly.
S35-C03-R35_005810-007620	Okay [HES] why not computer science? Honestly, I loved computer science but I didn't attend the .. the .. the session because .. given by professor Slim, because I knew and ((I was hundred percent sure)) that he will convince me, so I had decided before %ma .. %ma .. before joining university that I wanted this.
S35-C03-R35_007620-008179	Why? I don't .. I don't know, maybe .. I don't know, there's no specific reason, maybe because of robotics.
S35-C03-R35_008179-008946	I love robotics. It's mainly about robotics, mechatronics, it's actually considered control and robotics, so ((that's what made me very interested in it)) .
S35-C03-R35_009982-012153	Okay, what did I learn? I learned the basics such as physics and math, this was all in the first two semesters, and then we learned mechanics, only basics, and then starting from semester six, we started ((learning)) mechatronics, that is control, that is classical control, and then mechanics control.
S35-C03-R35_012153-012836	Mechatronics involves control as well, and then modern control, most of it, hundred percent actually, is control.
S35-C03-R35_012836-013896	What else? The projects that we did were game .. CS game .. I don't remember, ((give me a moment to recall)), what other projects did we do?
S35-C03-R35_013896-014429	Yes, traffic system %b .. it was with FPGA.
S35-C03-R35_014662-015318	In terms of education, actually, if I will compare what I have learned outside university and what I learned at university.
S35-C03-R35_015685-016171	Actually, when I worked on other projects, actually, I am working on a car.
S35-C03-R35_017470-018906	Okay, ((it differs from time to time)), but usually, I wake up, go to the university, I'm not .. actually I'm not a person who likes having morning breakfast, so I go to the university, attend the tutorials and so, if I feel hungry midday, %b .. I go home, have breakfast.
S35-C03-R35_018906-019870	I finish my lectures then I go to check whether I have a project, an assignment or a quiz.
S35-C03-R35_020721-021552	Okay [HES], I don't know, [HES] ((it's been a while)) %ma .. I haven't done that, but sometimes .. actually sometimes, I can travel to El Sokhna or go back to Alexandria.
S35-C03-R35_021552-022990	But since I am in mechatronics at X university, so it's a little bit difficult to go back or travel or %akh .. make .. make plans for me in the weekend.
S35-C03-R35_023262-023388	Yes.
S35-C03-R35_024297-025608	I like reading mostly in English actually, things I mean, for instance, the best .. there are two books that influenced me, one called Rules of Life and the other is called For One More Day.
S35-C03-R35_025608-026256	I don't .. don't .. quotes, I don't remember, but, no, these two books, I mean, I don't know, they actually influenced me.
S35-C03-R35_026509-026627	Of course [LAUGHTER] .
S35-C03-R35_027087-027217	I listen to everything.
S35-C03-R35_027450-028089	Definitely, there are specific artists, but actually %ma .. %ma .. there's problem to try and listen new stuff, that's all.
S35-C03-R35_029352-030360	Okay there was a movie called Collateral Beauty, it is famous actually, so that .. so that movie attracted me personally to be honest, it was great, this is the film I loved the most actually.
S35-C03-R35_030611-031129	It's story is about a successful person, he was .. he was a businessman or I can't really remember what he was.
S35-C03-R35_031129-033569	He was successful in .. in his life and so, then he had he has a simple family, of a daughter and a wife, his daughter was diagnosed with cancer so he life was suddenly ruined, we wasn't getting his work done, he lost everything, even his friends abandoned him, as he had to make some decisions and he didn't make any decisions, he was not working at all.
S35-C03-R35_033569-034569	And then they tried helping him to to get him out of this phase by those who resemble death and love and something else, I don't remember what it was.
S35-C03-R35_034569-035239	That's it, so in the end, he ((realized)) and .. and actually he got over it, that's all.
S35-C03-R35_036142-036329	Where do I work or what do I work in?
S35-C03-R35_036436-036562	What?
S35-C03-R35_036562-037029	I work in my field, honestly, which is, mechatronics.
S35-C03-R35_037029-037791	What would I like to work in? %ma .. not .. R .. R & D actually I am currently working in something similar to R & D, engineering, something like that.
S35-C03-R35_039337-040112	I was working at X company that, it manufactured cars nor manufacturing cars but fixing actually, and sometimes manufactures.
S35-C03-R35_040112-041044	So in the beginning, they leave you, ((just like that)), %ma .. ((living your life)), doing nothing, they don't help you %t .. to learn, if you want to learn, you should ask, and so on.
S35-C03-R35_041044-042112	That's it, so in the first two days, I discovered this and then I kept ((annoying the engineer)) till we became friends and he taught me a lot of things about cars that, so, no, I didn't know it before nor would I have ever.
S35-C03-R35_042810-043073	No, working life is better.
S35-C03-R35_043374-043584	Why?
S35-C03-R35_043584-045316	I apply what I have learned or ((I try out things on my own)), I mean it's not just .. not theoretical equations or systematic or .. or whatever, no, you .. you try something, try and error, try and error, %t .. you find out where the problem is, you try solving it using different ways, and so on.
S35-C03-R35_045808-045957	No, unfortunately.
S35-C03-R35_046570-046698	A place or a country?
S35-C03-R35_046804-047444	They are a lot places, ((well)), could be Japan for example, could be Germany.
S35-C03-R35_047444-048164	Anything related to the engineering .. as in engineering-wise, they are the top, actually.
S35-C03-R35_049648-050410	No, I will travel, of course, ((nothing much)), I already live alone, so for me, it's nothing .. nothing will be difficult, God willing.
S35-C03-R35_050410-050830	[HES] what will influence my decision?
S35-C03-R35_050830-051873	%ma .. nothing in particular actually, as long as the .. the opportunity itself is good and I like it or if I like that field or whatever %h .. %h .. I will go for it
S35-C03-R35_052164-052273	Yes.
S35-C03-R35_053971-055642	In general, I am a person .. a person who loves the sea actually, so for me, any place in which there is a sea or in particular the Red Sea, this is perfect for me, as I went diving in the .. in the Red Sea, and that was in Hurghada, it was amazing, honestly.
S35-C03-R35_056462-056699	When I started living alone.
S35-C03-R35_057029-057456	Everything, nearly, I have changed a hundred .. hundred eighty degrees honestly, everything.
S35-C03-R35_057456-057625	Like what?
S35-C03-R35_057625-058222	I felt I have become much more mature, responsible for everything.
S35-C03-R35_058222-058895	Not mature anymore, yes sorry what's that? sorry [LAUGHTER], actually, it's not ..
S35-C03-R35_058895-059146	What's it called?
S35-C03-R35_059632-060387	I mean, I am not reckless at all, I think about what I will do before doing it, it must be hundred percent correct.
S35-C03-R35_060490-060694	That's what I can think about right now actually.
S35-C03-R35_061456-061564	No, in teams.
S35-C03-R35_061936-062957	[HES] Initially for the sake of ideas actually, I mean, I may have an idea, so others might have a better idea than mine, so we can work on it.
S35-C03-R35_062957-063792	[HES] Maybe one of the members in the team has better knowledge than .. me so ((we can finalize the project easily)) .
S35-C03-R35_063792-064294	((We will support one another)), maybe someone is busy or has something else to do, he will support the other one, and so on.
S35-C03-R35_065554-065688	Elon Musk.
S35-C03-R35_065688-067065	Why? Because I feel that he started everything on his own from .. from scratch, literally, and he created several .. several ideas and he was nearly, the same idea, working on R&D Engineering.
S35-C03-R35_067730-067880	Respected
S35-C03-R35_067880-069253	Why? because when I'm respected people %ht .. %ht they will like me, will respect me, because, for instance, I'm successful in so and so or I'm doing something in a certain way, so yes, respect him so they will like him.
S35-C03-R35_070375-070484	No, no it's easy.
S35-C03-R35_070484-070587	Easy.
S35-C03-R35_071486-071708	I don't get how social level is different?
S35-C03-R35_072426-072658	No, I don't feel this way.
S35-C03-R35_072658-073144	Not .. not %b .. I don't change anything, my attitude remains the same.
S35-C03-R35_073864-074258	It depends on the way he talks, I mean, my brain synchronizes it with him
S35-C03-R35_074258-075209	I mean, if he speaks Arabic only, so my brain .. for example, my brain will talk to him in Arabic, but if he talks in English, it ((will come spontaneously)), I don't .. don't .. don't change .. it's not international at all.
S35-C03-R35_076243-077118	[HES] This is %b .. I think or take anything %b .. I think about it a lot.
S35-C03-R35_077118-077903	If it's not .. not as the saying goes that some people follow their hearts in decisions or something, no this ((is unacceptable for me)), it's just my mind only.
S35-C03-R35_078775-079775	He doesn't change the way he thinks, I mean, no, I'm right, there isn't .. his opinion is right and there is nothing else.
S35-C03-R35_080695-080911	The most thing that makes me stressed and pressured and uncomfortable?
S35-C03-R35_080911-081730	To be in an unfair position [HES] I don't know how to explain it, but for example ..
S35-C03-R35_081842-082154	For example, let's say, as .. as a team, ((we all get assigned tasks in the project)) .
S35-C03-R35_082342-082417	Even, I mean.
S35-C03-R35_082417-083070	No, everyone stops working and I'm the only one who's working, I will be working but I won't .. I won't be happy doing this, I won't be comfortable actually.
S35-C03-R35_083448-083936	No, I talk to them. Actually, I should talk to them, as it's not fair.
S35-C03-R35_085739-085854	[HUM] Yes.
S35-C03-R35_086010-086297	No, I will never think about it [LAUGHTER] what happened?
S35-C03-R35_086617-086768	[HES] not .. not ..
S35-C03-R35_086816-086976	Just recently.
S35-C03-R35_086976-088142	Okay there was an evaluation for instance, where I was busy, I had other projects to work on, so my team did the project, honestly, actually, I helped them with a project and they helped me in this one.
S35-C03-R35_088142-089879	And .. and nobody explained .. actually we had no time to explain .. they didn't have time to explain the project to me or what they did in the project, so I was asked in the .. in this evaluation .. how did you do this and so? So, I saw the .. actually, I tried to improvise, and thank God, I was right, actually [LAUGHTER] .
S35-C03-R35_090392-090832	Mobile, not at all, nor a smart phone nor .. nor ..
S35-C03-R35_090832-090944	No.
S35-C03-R35_091043-092453	Why? Because, I mean, if I needed .. I mean let's say if I needed something from someone or if I want to reach somebody who's away from me %b .. %b .. with thousands of kilometers, it's .. how I can reach him, that's it.
S35-C03-R35_092453-093063	If I needed, for instance, info from someone, or somebody did something ((similar)), if I needed ..
S35-C03-R35_093063-093414	Actually, it's hard .. it's difficult.
S35-C03-R35_095157-096403	I believe that people in general let's say if I'm talking to somebody who is not convinced with an idea, so .. but, if I keep ((stressing on it)), on his own actually, he will be convinced.
S35-C03-R35_096533-096665	Not at once, throughout time.
S35-C03-R35_096665-098101	For example, if I told him that X is a bad person, no, and he believes that he is a hundred percent good person, but after that ((he saw one bad doing from his side)), ((and then a second one, and a third,)) he will start .. this idea will grow and grow until he really hates him.
S35-C03-R35_098101-098738	I might actually want him to hate him, but in a way that is psy, I mean, psychological rather than going to him and persuading him to quarrel with him.
S36-C03-R36_000917-001424	Okay, I am from Cairo, I live in Nasr City.
S36-C03-R36_001424-001664	I was in a national school.
S36-C03-R36_001664-002712	A Francophone school, its first language was French and the second language was English, and that's it.
S36-C03-R36_003639-004697	Okay I'm studying engineering, but my first year, was general engineering, general, and later on, in the second year, it was supposed to be the same scenario, then afterwards I choose the major in the third year.
S36-C03-R36_004697-005603	In the third year, I chose my major in the very beginning, I chose the major of [HES] Electronics, I spent there a semester and half .. yes, a semester and half.
S36-C03-R36_005603-006115	[HES] I felt that the major wasn't nice, I didn't like it.
S36-C03-R36_006115-008595	Originally, at the very beginning, I was confused between two majors, computer science and electronics, so at the end, ((after a lot of agony)), and ((after many conversations)) and quarrels with my father and mother and friends and I asked a lot of people, I ((I took the huge decision)), actually, that I will change major and I went for computer science and till now actually, so far actually, I don't know what I should go for, I mean.
S36-C03-R36_009739-011419	Okay after actually I got transferred to Computer Science, the first year was mainly about the basics of .. for instance, in web development, we learned, for example, how to develop mobile applications for example, we learned how to create websites, we learned how to do image processing.
S36-C03-R36_011419-012091	[HES] Currently, we are doing .. currently I'm in the .. in the fourth year .. yes fourth year.
S36-C03-R36_012091-012709	Bachelor project, my bachelor project is about a topic called Deep Reinforcement Learning.
S36-C03-R36_012709-013609	Mainly discussed about, it is about how, for example, to teach something that is called an agent.
S36-C03-R36_013609-014616	I should teach this agent, supposedly, as if it's a child, how to, for example walk, how to make a certain action through algorithm techniques.
S36-C03-R36_014616-016740	I'm the one who teaches him and I'm the one who tells him how to do it, by it doing training for a certain number of episodes for instance, it is supposed that after it finishes them it reaches %l .. certain values for example that it knows for example if it takes this action it will receive a following reward system and so far.
S36-C03-R36_016740-017278	And in the very end, he reaches a state that he learns what to do at the very end, that's it.
S36-C03-R36_018027-018778	There is no daily routine actually, I wake up in the morning, I wash my face, I brush my teeth, dress up and go out
S36-C03-R36_018778-021144	Mainly, everyday, I get up in the morning, it's one of two options, either ((I was awake)) until six am and I wake up at nine for a certain reason, actually, or I .. that's it, so I sleep at six then when I go home I expect that I will normally sleep and then wake up .. and wake up for example at 4 pm, 3 pm, 2 pm, after 12 o'clock most importantly, I mean.
S36-C03-R36_021781-021942	Yes, I like playing soccer.
S36-C03-R36_021942-022821	I like playing soccer [HES] I used to play crossfit almost five years ago, yes, five years ago I used to play crossfit.
S36-C03-R36_022821-024093	[HES] Sometimes I like jogging, when I was young I used to play since .. until .. when I was four or six .. when I was six years old, yes, from the age of two till the age of twelve, I used to swim.
S36-C03-R36_024093-025028	[HES] but currently I mean the most thing actually %b .. I do from time to time or weekly actually is playing football with my friends actually.
S36-C03-R36_025282-026310	[HES] No, but I have read, for instance, in my whole life, actually, I might have read three books, including two novels.
S36-C03-R36_026310-027410	[HES] And the third book was about .. actually it was a biography of a well-known person actually and so, so I just wanted to .. interested to know about his life.
S36-C03-R36_027410-027964	And to know actually his opinions ((in life, regarding living)) and so on.
S36-C03-R36_028533-030367	Yeah, I listen to .. I listen to different kinds, actually, actually, for example, I listen to .. but mainly most of them are in English and very few in Arabic and in the case of Arabic, I listen to bands that are undergrounds such as bands, and so on.
S36-C03-R36_030367-031017	But, those old singers and so on, I don't usually listen to them, but ..
S36-C03-R36_031017-031492	Or for example Jordanian bands, Algerian bands.
S36-C03-R36_031492-032730	Things weird like that, that is for Arabic actually, for English, I listen many things but .. but there is no certain type of music, a specific one, I mean.
S36-C03-R36_033551-033822	[HES] Is it okay to mention his name or not?
S36-C03-R36_033822-034906	Okay, a movie called secret life of Walter Mitty, it is not initially a well-known movie actually, actually few people know it, but, some people know that it was for Ben Stiller.
S36-C03-R36_034906-035675	The movie is about a man who was living inside a bubble, he had a desk job.
S36-C03-R36_035675-037819	[HES] He had a certain daily routine everyday, ((that he doesn't change, everyday)), he just goes .. goes to the company, takes the .. takes for example the metro and arrives at the company at eight o'clock, then he goes to, for example .. he develops pictures, he develops pictures, then he posts it in a magazine and then his whole life is the same.
S36-C03-R36_037819-038285	The point is that one day he decided that he is fed up with his daily routine.
S36-C03-R36_038285-040510	And he got fed up with going over twenty thousand photos, so there is another world, there is another world %bey .. %bey .. they see a lot of things in that he keeps watching, that's it, he decides to change this daily routine, and .. and to express himself and to focus on his talents in the world.
S36-C03-R36_040510-040857	And .. and and the movies takes us with him somehow actually.
S36-C03-R36_041739-042664	[HES] I swear, actually, I have been asking myself this question for a while, till now there is no .. there is no specific answer actually to it.
S36-C03-R36_042664-043634	But there is .. I have some kind of imagination in mind, it does not have to be necessarily correct, that I wish, for example, to work in .. in a company that doesn't really have a routine.
S36-C03-R36_043634-044849	A company that has a nice working environment and at the same time we are doing something .. actually something .. something good, something valuable actually, something that benefits people.
S36-C03-R36_045295-046980	Of course, I mean, for instance, I wish to work as a developer but not .. not to work on things that are basics, I won't work on traditional things, no, I mean, at least we work on sophisticated things, sophisticated things, things .
S36-C03-R36_046980-048191	Things like for example the working environment in actually .. actually .. actually there are some specific companies in my mind, but, actually .. actually the working environment should be nice, this is the most important thing to me.
S36-C03-R36_049028-049816	Yes, internship, I did an internship before, almost two years and half or 3 years ago.
S36-C03-R36_049816-050211	[HES] The duration of the internship was one month.
S36-C03-R36_050275-051358	I was supposed to deal with an aircraft systems actually and so on and how planes %b .. function and its mechanical system.
S36-C03-R36_051358-051775	At that time I was in Electronics, it was kind of related to my major.
S36-C03-R36_051775-052288	I knew such things, I was a bit related to it, as I was more interested in the topic.
S36-C03-R36_052288-052907	[HES] I tried working part-time or full-time but actually so far ((I'm still searching)) actually.
S36-C03-R36_054212-055086	[HES] it depends on .. on what I've said a while ago, it depends on where you are going to work.
S36-C03-R36_055086-055833	Actually, I'm still convinced that ((no matter what)), there is still advantage in the student life.
S36-C03-R36_055833-058117	That you have the concept that you're, yes, okay, we live in .. in .. in responsibilities and deadlines and assignments and that we should do this and we should do that, and so on, but, still, ((at the end)), we finish a semester and take two weeks vacation and then we finish the second semester and take three months vacation, all of this won't be there in the .. in the working life.
S36-C03-R36_058117-058439	At most, we will have a two weeks holiday, this is my maximum.
S36-C03-R36_058439-059640	But, the point is, if I have a good working environment, if I'm working in a company that has a good working environment, people are nice there, there's no routine, no boredom, it will definitely be much better.
S36-C03-R36_060208-061227	Yes, I traveled .. I traveled %k .. as in touristic and traveled because actually .. actually for example I traveled a long time ago when I was young to Lebanon.
S36-C03-R36_061227-061566	After that I traveled with my friends, for instance, abroad.
S36-C03-R36_061566-062717	We went on a trip in the as senior year actually but it wasn't a senior trip and so, no, it was like a trip, we traveled, ((all of us)), in summer to Paris for a week.
S36-C03-R36_062717-063394	[HES] after that I traveled [HES] to Spain, I traveled to Paris again.
S36-C03-R36_063394-064778	[HES] I stayed before .. yes I stayed in Emirates before, my dad was there so I used to go there frequently so I used to, for example, stay with him, for instance, sometimes three months, sometimes four months, and so on actually.
S36-C03-R36_065693-067119	There was when my father was in Emirates and so we .. I was actually because I used to have a lot of free time, as I was staying there for three or four months actually I was spending the whole summer there, so, of course, I will not stay alone, I mean, so I used to get in touch with people.
S36-C03-R36_067119-068004	There was for example a fun fact, actually, I came back home, I though what am I going to do, so I searched for a facebook group for Egyptians living in Emirates.
S36-C03-R36_068004-068851	So I found a group for Egyptians living in Emirates, ((I introduced myself to them)) and I told them ((where I live)) and that I want to play soccer.
S36-C03-R36_068851-070334	They told me, okay, we will pass by you and so suddenly I found some people calling me and telling me that they are waiting for me outside and that I should join them, then we went to play soccer and every now and then when I returned I would inform them that I am coming in a week for instance, and I began to keep in touch, but, now of course, ((I'm no longer doing this)) actually.
S36-C03-R36_071863-073618	No, I will go for it for sure, and actually the things that will make me .. I will go for it ((in all cases)), as a job offer or as a scholarship, I will go for it in all cases, but what factors might affect my decision or might let me for example think to back down and for example not to take this decision, it depends of course on the .. the .. the place or the country.
S36-C03-R36_073618-074456	Because I believe or I have a theory that says that .. that there are a lot of racist countries, so this annoys me.
S36-C03-R36_074456-075929	And at the same time, also if the .. the .. the job offer itself or the .. the scholarship or whatever is not guaranteed or for example is not paid or the .. actually ..
S36-C03-R36_075929-077145	Okay, sometimes the job offers for example don't mention that they will guarantee the accommodations for you, or that they won't guarantee for you the how you are going to live, all that, for me, will definitely make a difference, so I need to think about it.
S36-C03-R36_077145-077413	[HES] What else for example?
S36-C03-R36_077413-078248	Yes, it could be that one factor among other factors that will have an impact is, for example, whether I know people, for instance, in the place I'm going to or not.
S36-C03-R36_078248-078725	So, all of these are actually ((affecting)) factors.
S36-C03-R36_079594-081119	[HES] There was, for example, this was the most prominent turning point technically in my life, two years ago, I actually faced some problems with .. with .. with some people actually in my life.
S36-C03-R36_081119-082723	So, these problems caused me to suffer from minor depression or depression so the point is that stayed in this phase for a long period of time, it was around two months for example, two months and half, approximately, something like that.
S36-C03-R36_082723-083022	So, the issue was that I wasn't %b .. wasn't do anything at all.
S36-C03-R36_083022-083302	I didn't like the major itself.
S36-C03-R36_083634-084773	Actually my grades actually were bad, everything was .. didn't .. didn't .. I didn't understand anything at the university, I didn't understand anything in the tutorials, my relationship with people kept deteriorating because I was becoming more of an introvert.
S36-C03-R36_084773-085177	[HES] so .. so .. so I wasn't pleased from what was going on.
S36-C03-R36_085177-085822	So, the idea was that I was trying to get myself out of this bubble, of this terrible bubble.
S36-C03-R36_085822-086414	So .. so .. so of course I started of course to get back on my feet.
S36-C03-R36_086414-087180	And I was trying to say no, not everything is related to these people, and not everything is related to me, or that I did nothing wrong, for instance.
S36-C03-R36_087180-087878	[HES] The major, for example, was one of the decisions that .. that were important, that I believe was really correct, as I had changed the major.
S36-C03-R36_087878-088728	Actually, right now, I believe I am better, more stable, more interested in my studies, more interested in the future, so all of this was a turning point I think, I mean.
S36-C03-R36_089196-090648	Yes, actually .. actually I feel I am a bit more mature now, I mean, previously, I was, for example, yes, okay, actually there was life, and there was something called .. something called life, there used to be cooperation between people people.
S36-C03-R36_090648-092004	All these things, all of it, yes, used to be there, for me, and it was on my mind, but the point is that one had to reach a certain limit or a certain point which teaches you what you should do or what you should not do.
S36-C03-R36_092004-094411	So, I see that this was the .. the point taught me this, it taught me how to deal with people, how to back track, how to %a .. %a do this or not to do this, how to %a .. to be very popular or not to be very popular or what things actually .. matters in general %k .. as in, for example, somebody who sees you in a certain way or doesn't see you in a certain way, all such things.
S36-C03-R36_095442-095758	No, most of the time, I used to prefer working alone, honestly.
S36-C03-R36_095758-096390	But why? Because most of the time I ended up in teams that weren't actually nice.
S36-C03-R36_096390-097240	[HES] And they didn't offer help or anything ((and they actually gave me a hard time)) .
S36-C03-R36_097240-097787	For example, I keep trying to search for them, and calling them to ((check where they are)) .
S36-C03-R36_097787-098998	So I used to tell them that I will do some things, actually, for example, I remember, for example, there was a project among the projects I was working on [HES], we used to create something like a game, so this game was supposed to be created by the four of us.
S36-C03-R36_098998-100314	Till now, the deadline was on Thursday and until Tuesday we didn't do anything, so of course, I said, ((that's it)), ((that won't do)), so I started working on it, and that was it actually.
S36-C03-R36_101199-102342	I swear .. I swear, actually, there used to a role model, but I don't know whether he is good or not or still, actually .. actually considered to be my role model or not, but when I was young .. I mean when I was .. when I was freshman year, for instance, he was my role model.
S36-C03-R36_102342-102555	He was a person called Steve jobs, ((that's it)) .
S36-C03-R36_102555-103535	But the point is actually %m .. %m .. I don't feel that he is very impactful, but at the same time, it is impactful in a particular certain way, what is the particular certain aspect?
S36-C03-R36_103535-104092	We was very very very self-confident person, ((although he had no knowledge about anything)), literally.
S36-C03-R36_104092-105157	He has nothing to do with engineering or with computer engineering or anything related to .. to .. to the circuit or the electronic circuit or anything else
S36-C03-R36_105157-105563	But in the end, he became the owner of Apple company.
S36-C03-R36_105563-105851	And at the same time, he opened .. he created the Apple company.
S36-C03-R36_105851-106196	He was fired from it, so he created something called Pixar.
S36-C03-R36_106196-106337	He then returned back to Apple.
S36-C03-R36_106337-107057	So all of this, I mean, of course I actually .. I mean, I think that if I were in this person's shoe, for example, ((I won't do most of what he has done)) .
S36-C03-R36_107057-107441	So .. so it's just that .. this attracted me, the idea of ..
S36-C03-R36_107441-107658	And yet there was was still someone called
S36-C03-R36_107871-108178	Never mind, that is his .. his partner.
S36-C03-R36_108178-108576	That is Steve Wozniak .. yes, exactly.
S36-C03-R36_108576-109118	This is actually the true inventor of let's just say, for example, the first personal computer.
S36-C03-R36_109118-109969	He didn't really do anything as he invented things but he didn't have the vision, he didn't have the .. the idea so that's okay what am I going to do?
S36-C03-R36_109969-110353	So he .. so Steve Jobs was the one who came and supported him, and all of this for him.
S36-C03-R36_110353-110770	So this .. this .. this, for me, was what .. what I liked in him.
S36-C03-R36_110770-111046	But I don't know whether he's still considered a role model or not
S36-C03-R36_112170-113218	[HES] Maybe liked, I think, because if you are liked, you are respected somehow I mean, that's it.
S36-C03-R36_114183-114285	No, man, what is this?
S36-C03-R36_114400-114524	You found me in the corridor.
S36-C03-R36_114524-114913	[HES] No, I mean, [HES] that
S36-C03-R36_114913-116870	No, I mean, ((well)), I don't think I'm a person .. I mean a difficult person because, ((in all cases)), I actually I used to originally be a person who found it difficult to interact with people but, with time, I started ((fixing this in me)), so I started to respect this thing in people so I started trying as much as possible ((go easy on)) people.
S36-C03-R36_116870-117962	I am okay, if you don't want to talk, ((no problem)), but ((well)) we can joke, do anything, if you want to talk, ((okay)), we can hang out even if I don't know you at all, that's all, this is the whole idea.
S36-C03-R36_118603-119464	[HES] That I'm trying to be helpful as much as possible with .. with people.
S36-C03-R36_119464-120552	Or that I try to help anyone in need or to listen to them, that's it, so for me, I believe this really that's good, I don't want to change that.
S36-C03-R36_121643-122817	If this person is selfish or he is %b .. ((is unfair to someone)) and he thinks only about himself so this is not .. not nice actually, this is selfishness, with no reason at all
S36-C03-R36_122817-123634	So .. so especially if he also has no reason if he is being unfair to people around him and these people love him, so, no, actually, yes this is really bad.
S36-C03-R36_124360-124827	[HES] What really makes me feel stressed?
S36-C03-R36_124827-126132	I swear, it's not .. not .. actually, it could be the idea that you should get your life together by a certain age or by certain rate.
S36-C03-R36_126132-126677	So .. so .. so .. this means .. this means .. ((we are all in the same situation)), you understand.
S36-C03-R36_126677-127819	That is, what are we going to do? Well, ((we are forced to do so)), we keep learning, we keep working and we keep trying to get for example part-time job, we try to get a certain job, we try to ((figure where our life is heading)) .
S36-C03-R36_127819-128326	So the idea of that you you have to get your life together, it also frustrates me a bit, that's it.
S36-C03-R36_129740-130214	Yes, very often, I used to .. actually, I remember there was an interview in a club.
S36-C03-R36_130214-131785	One of the clubs, I mean, he was asking me about something, so ((I decided to just say anything)) and so on and so on, and let's just say so and so and so and .. ((just to save the day)) and then I gave him the .. I told him, ((that's it)), thank you, merci and ((that's it)) .
S36-C03-R36_132357-132659	I can live without a mobile because, in all cases, I'm technically living without a mobile .
S36-C03-R36_132659-132877	Why do I live without a mobile in the first place? Because my mobile is broken.
S36-C03-R36_132877-133213	And I'm using a Nokia, you get it, three thousand and two hundred, something like that.
